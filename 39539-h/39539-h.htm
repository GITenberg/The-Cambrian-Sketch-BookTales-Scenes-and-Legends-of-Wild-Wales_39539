<p>Among the illustrious men and women of Cambria it would be
difficult to select one to whom this book could be so
appropriately inscribed as your ladyship.&nbsp; You are, and ever
have been, the warm and sincere friend of my country; you are
profoundly versed in her historic, poetic, literary, and
legendary annals; you are a liberal and munificent contributor to
almost every great movement designed to promote the social and
intellectual, the moral and religious, welfare of the people of
our ancient Principality; and you have attained a high and
imperishable fame as a graceful and eloquent writer.&nbsp; In
these pages your ladyship will find depicted scenes connected
with the past history of the land; tales of years that are gone,
which <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>roll
before us with their dark or splendid deeds, and specimens of the
wild but graceful legends which have shed a poetic charm upon
almost every nook and corner of Wales.&nbsp; I cherish the hope
that their perusal will afford your ladyship delight and
pleasure, while their contents, possibly, may help to increase
your ladyship&rsquo;s interest in and attachment to the land you
so much love.</p>

<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The history of the Cambrian race is interesting not only to
the antiquarian, but also to all real lovers of traditional and
legendary lore.&nbsp; It is a race which had its origin in the
mythical age, in the far back and remote past, in that period of
the world&rsquo;s history when intellectual and moral darkness
covered the earth, and when gross darkness, like a black pall,
enveloped the minds of the people.&nbsp; The country which this
race originally occupied is simply a matter of
conjecture&mdash;an unascertained fact; while the period when the
Cambrian people first left their own native soil, the land of
their love and their fondest affection, and wandered over hill
and plain, over mountain and dismal swamp, through woods and
primeval forests, wading through <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>mighty fordable rivers, and
crossing stormy seas, until they reached the pebbled strand of
this our sea-girt isle, is still a matter of
uncertainty&mdash;one of the mysteries of this mysterious
world.&nbsp; That they occupied this island, and were in
undisturbed possession of it many hundred years before the
appearance in our world of Him who is the true Light of humanity,
there exists abundance of evidence; and it is not unlikely, but
on the contrary highly probable, that sections of this ancient
people were <i>then</i> engaged, as <i>now</i>, in developing the
mineral wealth of the country.</p>
<p>Coming down to a later date, a less remote period, we have
actual descriptive accounts of the Welsh people, of their manners
and customs, their habits and mode of life, their religious rites
and form of worship; and considering the then state of the world,
we are astonished at the comparative high state of civilization
to which this ancient race had at that time attained.&nbsp; But
to trace the history of their civilization down <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>through the
ages is foreign to my present purpose, however tempting the
theme.&nbsp; The object I had in view in preparing this work for
the press, was not to place before the reader a consecutive
narrative, but to select topics with a view to illustrate some of
the traits of character of this ancient, singular, and extremely
interesting people&mdash;a people who, in spite of oppression,
injustice, and isolation, have nobly clung to the old faith; who
have ever as citizens been loyal, patriotic, and virtuous; and
who, moreover, in the face of very serious disadvantages, have
obtained a position of intellectual and moral manhood, which
cannot fail to inspire us with admiration and wonder.&nbsp; Let
me say here, that if this work deepens the Welshman&rsquo;s love
of country, and induces the English reader to regard us in a more
favourable light than that adopted by a class of Saxon critics, I
shall consider I have not laboured in vain.</p>
<p>As regards the tales and sketches of this volume, they are not
ideal pictures of Cambrian life and character, but are for the <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>most part
founded on fact.&nbsp; For example, the ascent of Snowdon was
undertaken alone, some ten years ago, and by the most difficult,
tedious, and hazardous route.&nbsp; I often wonder at my want of
prudence in ascending from Capel Curig, that glorious old Alpine
height, on a cold, dank, and misty autumnal morning, without a
guide or a friendly hand to point the way.&nbsp; Alone I
accomplished the journey, without experiencing much difficulty,
or meeting a single mishap.&nbsp; The story of Dunraven Castle is
founded on a historical fact.&nbsp; It is one of the most painful
of the many painful incidents of those terrible times.&nbsp;
Parson Jones is not an ideal but a real character painted from
life.&nbsp; His fame as a charmer, a conjuror, and magician, was
celebrated far and wide.&nbsp; I well remember farmers&rsquo;
wives and others visiting him in order to secure his assistance
in driving away evil spirits from their dwellings.&nbsp; A
wonderful man was Parson Jones!&nbsp; An able divine, a true
preacher of the cross, a lovable and childlike man was he.&nbsp;
When <a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>his
body was consigned to the tomb, the people felt that they had
lost one of their best earthly friends.&nbsp; As to the legends
of Lake Savathan and Elidorus, they have been handed down in
written history.&nbsp; The tale of Cadwgan is a real picture of
Cambrian life.&nbsp; The story of Saint Winifred is founded on an
old Welsh legend.&nbsp; A marvellous work has recently been
written by one of England&rsquo;s greatest novelists; it is not
impossible that the idea of the &ldquo;Coming Race&rdquo; had its
origin in the tale of Elidorus.</p>
<p>In this work I have avoided the literary paths trodden by
previous Cambrian authors: writers who, in their own sphere of
literature, have left behind them imperishable names.&nbsp; I
believe that the mine of wealth I have endeavoured to explore is
new, while virgin is the soil.&nbsp; Deeply interesting are the
legends which have been handed down from a people, who, alas!
alas! no longer tread the sacred ground of wild Wales.&nbsp; In
the selection of topics, I have only discovered <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>for the
theme of my pen a few precious gems, having culled here and there
a few fair and fragrant flowers, thus leaving for future literary
labours, many others of tints equally beautiful and sweets
equally delicious.&nbsp; Almost every dell and hamlet, every
sylvan glade and mountain side of wild Wales abounds with legends
and tales, stories of real life which are too interesting to be
lost, and too important in the lessons they afford to remain hid
in the bosom of members of our ancient race.</p>
<p>It is possible that exception will be taken to the ideal
pictures&mdash;creations of the author&rsquo;s fancy&mdash;of the
fairies and fairy land, which form rather a prominent feature of
this work.&nbsp; For introducing to the reader the people of the
fairy kingdom beneath the bay of Swansea, I have no apology to
make.&nbsp; In the thoughts they breathe and in the opinions they
express they are very human, while the land in which they dwell
bears witness to the presence of the energizing power and
infinite benevolence of the Supreme.&nbsp; From <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>our
childhood we have been accustomed to listen to the wonderful
tales relating to Lilliputian races, in which the narrators
described their sayings and doings, their gambols and frolics,
their pranks and merry-making, their sweet music and dulcet
notes; and in our wanderings, we have often gazed on the green
rings wherein they danced on mead and meadow.&nbsp; And are we
not ready to confess that those fairy stories possessed a special
charm&mdash;an interest which even reality itself hardly
awakens?&nbsp; I am aware that belief in the existence of those
a&euml;rial forms, those ghostly, impalpable, and ambiguous
beings, has been regarded as an evidence of mental blindness, and
the absence of high culture and civilization.&nbsp; This charge
cannot be maintained.&nbsp; The peoples of all European nations
believe in the existence of those wonderful people, and,
personally, I should regret to see their faith undermined.&nbsp;
Fairies are associated with the spiritual and super-human; with
virtue and purity; thus they help us to look upward to the
spirit-world, where flesh <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>and blood, where materialism and its
unhallowed fruits have not, and can never have, even a temporary
lodgment.</p>
<p>Should this work meet with the approval of my
fellow-countrymen, I shall in the early part of next spring issue
a second volume of the Cambrian Sketch-Book.&nbsp; I shall
include in that volume: Sir Rice ap Thomas, a historical romance,
already written; and The Lost Son Found, a tale of the Lowland
Hundred.&nbsp; A beautiful country was Cantref-y-Gwaelod, where
now roll the waters of the Atlantic&mdash;a magnificent plain
with fortified cities, and co-extensive with Cardigan Bay.&nbsp;
Several other legends and tales of North and South Wales will
also appear in the intended volume.</p>
<p>It now only remains for me to express my hearty thanks to
Charles Bath, Esq., of Fynone, for his kindness in placing at my
service a very old view of Swansea, a faithful transcript of
which has been made by the artist for the present volume.&nbsp; I
make this public acknowledgment to our townsman for the reason
that he is <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>always ready to aid all efforts having in view the
publication and circulation of works relating to dear old
Cambria.</p>

<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>ASCENT
OF SNOWDON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How high and swift flits the thin rack
along,<br />
Skirted with rainbow dyes; now deep below&mdash;<br />
While the fierce sun strikes the illumined top,<br />
Slow sails the gloomy storm, and all beneath,<br />
By vaporous exhalation hid, is lost<br />
In darkness: save at once where drifted mists,<br />
Cut by strong gusts of eddying winds, expose<br />
The transitory scene.<br />
Now swift on either side the gathered clouds,<br />
As by a sudden touch of magic, wide<br />
Recede, and the fair face of heaven and earth<br />
Appears.&nbsp; Amid the vast horizon&rsquo;s stretch,<br />
In restless gaze the eye of wonder darts<br />
O&rsquo;er the expanse,&mdash;mountains on mountains piled,<br />
And winding bays and promontories huge,<br />
And lakes and wandering rivers from their source<br />
Traced to the distant ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bingley&rsquo;s
Tour</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a bright and glorious August morning, in the year
18&mdash;, when, having a few weeks&rsquo; freedom from the busy
toils of official labour, I resolved to have an
&ldquo;out,&rdquo; as they call it in the north of England, where
I then resided&mdash;a brief tour of pleasure.&nbsp; Never in
these <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>northern latitudes had I witnessed a more lovely
morning.&nbsp; The sun shone brightly, and with a dazzling
splendour only surpassed by the gorgeous brilliancy of an Eastern
clime.&nbsp; When we looked upwards, not a cloud could be seen in
the concave hemisphere above.&nbsp; Far, far away, the most
distant objects could be plainly and distinctly seen.&nbsp; In
the forest not a spray moved, nor was there a sweet kiss of the
leaves on that breezeless morn.&nbsp; Neither on river nor lake
could there be discerned a single ripple.&nbsp; Everywhere,
except in the adjacent grove, did quietude and stillness
reign.&nbsp; There, however, the birds sent forth their merry and
joyous notes, and the tone of their voices, and the songs they
sung, told of joys, and proclaimed the existence of happy
feelings, which but few among the sons of men are permitted to
realize.&nbsp; Oh, how calm and how still was the scene
around!&nbsp; Indeed, all nature, except the winged songsters of
the grove, appeared to repose quietly and peacefully on the bosom
of its God.</p>
<p>A grand morning this, said I, for starting on an
&ldquo;out;&rdquo; but the pressing question was, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>whither should
I go.&nbsp; During my brief preparation, I fancied I heard the
voice of the eagle, and the voice said, &ldquo;Come to me.&nbsp;
Come and behold the high mountain whereon I dwell, and the great
rocks in which I build my nest.&nbsp; Come and see, from my high
elevation and Alpine heights, the magnificent lochs whose waters
spread far and wide in the broad and expansive valleys.&nbsp; Oh,
come, and behold the land of the brave and heroic
Wallace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment before deciding whether or not I should accept the
invitation of the king of birds, there was wafted on the gentle
breeze that had just sprung up, the voice of a little bird which
inhabits the far west; and the little bird said, &ldquo;Come and
visit the land in which I dwell.&nbsp; In this land you will
behold some of the greatest wonders of the world.&nbsp; Were you
to visit the North or the South, the East or the West, the sunny
fountains of Africa, the coral strands of India, or the icy
regions of the frigid zone, yet in no part of the wide world
could you discover objects so grand and majestic as our
Giant&rsquo;s Causeway; while Killarney is unrivalled for <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>sublime and
beautiful scenery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, little bird, said I, I love
your nation; your people have warm hearts and generous
sympathies.&nbsp; Just, however, as I was about saying
&ldquo;aye&rdquo; to the invitation of the little bird of the
Green Isle, there came from the south&mdash;o&rsquo;er moorland
valley, o&rsquo;er mighty rivers and hills, o&rsquo;er cities,
towns, and villages, the charming and enchanting voice of the
lark, and its tones were so winning and so sweet, that I was
almost moved to shed tears of joy.&nbsp; But what was the purport
of her song?&nbsp; The burden of her song was Cambria! the
beautiful and the blest; the land of Poetry and the Ideal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; carolled the lark, &ldquo;and behold some of
the beauties of Wild Wales.&nbsp; In no land are glades so
verdant, are rocks so rugged and bold, are cwms and dells so
exquisitely beautiful and lovely as are to be seen here.&nbsp;
Nowhere but here can you behold hill after hill, and mountain
after mountain, rise above each other, presenting a picture so
awfully wild, so grand, and so majestically sublime.&nbsp;
Besides,&rdquo; said the lark, &ldquo;this is your own
land.&nbsp; It is the place of your birth.&nbsp; It is the home
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of your
father&rsquo;s sepulchre.&nbsp; Oh! come here, for here are
generous hearts, ready to bid you welcome.&nbsp; In the border
land is many an old friend who will rejoice and kill the fatted
calf when he sees you approach his dwelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could
no longer resist the irresistible voice, and replied to her, Oh,
sweet songster of the moorland, thither will I go, and to-morrow
I will listen to your heavenly strains among your own hills.</p>
<p>I need not describe the journey from the North to Conway, as
it is familiar to most travellers.&nbsp; Nor shall I refer to the
beautiful Menai, or the magnificent ruins and historic renown of
the good old town of Carnarvon.&nbsp; Nor shall I refer, with a
view to depict the scene, to many other deeply-interesting spots,
some of which I could not but gaze upon with feelings of profound
reverence, the rather as they told the tales of other times,
which rolled before me with their deeds.&nbsp; As I looked upon
and contemplated these scenes, I was deeply affected, while my
vision was dimmed by the tears that welled up from my
heart.&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Moreover, as I still gazed upon the historic fields of
blood and battle, I thought I saw the shadow of my
country&rsquo;s martyrs and heroes passing before my
eyes&mdash;the shadows of the great and heroic men who, strong in
the righteousness of their cause, fought for the liberty of our
brave, courageous, and lion-hearted ancestors, and for the
independence and the freedom of the land of my love and my
sympathies.&nbsp; Since the days of that long and sanguinary
struggle, time and the disposition of men and nations have
immeasurably changed for the better.&nbsp; Happily for us, we
have now a ruler who loves her subjects, whose sway is the very
opposite of that despotic tyrant&rsquo;s rule, who loved to
imbrue his hands in the blood of contemporary princes.&nbsp;
Edward, however, has gone to his <i>place</i>.&nbsp; Oh that his
memory and his deeds of blood had perished with him!&nbsp; As I
looked upon the scene around Conway, and viewed it in relation to
and in connection with the dark deeds of Edward, the following
lines of the poet Gray came to my remembrance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;Hark how each giant oak and desert cave<br />
&nbsp; Sighs to the torrent&rsquo;s awful voice beneath!<br />
O&rsquo;er thee, O King, their hundred arms they wave,<br />
&nbsp; Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe,<br />
Vocal no more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Conway I proceeded to Llanrwst, thence to Bettws-y-Coed,
which is situated in a lovely verdant cwm, and is the most
charming and the most exquisitely beautiful spot I have ever
beheld.&nbsp; I have seen many an enchanting scene, but
Bettws-y-Coed is incomparably finer, and surpasses, both in
magnificent boldness and soft and quiet grandeur, any other
landscape upon which I have been permitted to gaze.&nbsp; As
night was rapidly approaching, and as I had arranged to ascend
Snowdon the following morning, I had to tear myself away from so
enchanting a scene.&nbsp; From there I proceeded to the Swallow
Falls, thence to Capel Curig, a village which affords some of the
most picturesque landscapes which can be met with in Wales.&nbsp;
Of this prospect it might be truly said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here hills and vales, the woodland and the
plain,<br />
Here earth and water seem to strive again;<br />
Not, chaos-like, together crushed and bruised,<br />
But, as the world, harmoniously confused.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>However, I lingered not to contemplate the scene, but
proceeded on my journey towards Penygwryd, which I reached just
as the great king of day disappeared behind the Cambrian
Alps.</p>
<p>The next morning, after partaking of an early breakfast of ham
and eggs and coffee, I proceeded to the hotel lawn to see whether
the day was favourable for an ascent of Yr Wyddfa, the
&ldquo;uwch y mynydd uchaf&rdquo; of England and Wales.&nbsp;
Since the previous day I regretted to find that the weather had
undergone a complete change; the summit of Eryri was now
enveloped in dark clouds, the morning was cold, and the air was
dank and chilly.&nbsp; The moaning of the wind in the great
mountain gullies and cwms rendered the scene both awful and
sublime.&nbsp; Meeting mine host on the lawn, I inquired if I
might venture to ascend Snowdon without the service of a
guide.&nbsp; He strongly dissuaded me from attempting an ascent
alone, as it would necessarily be attended with great risk.&nbsp;
However, after debating the matter some time, I resolved to carry
out my original design of going <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>unattended.&nbsp; When I reached the
summit I was delighted beyond measure at having accomplished the
ascent, by the longest and most difficult route, without the aid
of a guide.&nbsp; Having wished Mr. Owen a hearty farewell, I
commenced the ascent of Snowdon.&nbsp; Proceeding up the road
towards the Pass of Llanberis so far as Pen-y-Pass, I branched
off to the left, and soon came to Llyn Teyrn, thence taking the
trackless mountain above Cwm Dyli, direct towards Llyn Glaslyn;
and thence by a circuitous and difficult route, which a kind
mountain miner showed me, to the highest point of the Mother of
Hills.</p>
<p>Although I found this route laborious, I was amply recompensed
by beholding &ldquo;scenes of extraordinary wildness and
grandeur, over which solitude seemed to brood with undisturbed
silence, scarcely ever broken by the wing of bird or the voice of
melody.&rdquo;&nbsp; In every direction prospects the most
magnificent opened to view, and every crag and rock which I
surmounted was furnished with objects of picturesque effect or
deep and absorbing <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>interest.&nbsp; From many a crag I looked down upon the
cwms and deep dells beneath, and I fancied I could pick out here
and there the very dingles to which our heroic ancestors were
compelled to resort for protection, when pursued by numberless
hosts of the enemy after they had sustained defeat.&nbsp; In
these cwms they were, however, safe.&nbsp; Even proud and haughty
Edward dared not follow the Britons to their mountain
fastnesses.&nbsp; To them Snowdon had ever proved a kind and
guardian angel: hence the reason why they fled thither in the
hour of their defeat.&nbsp; No wonder, therefore, that they loved
the old mountain deeply and passionately; and no wonder, too,
that they composed songs to her honour and renown.</p>
<p>When I attained the summit of the mountain, the sight
presented to my view was awfully and majestically wild and
grand.&nbsp; The whole circuit of the Snowdonian range was
enveloped in a thick and dark mist, which was so dense that I
fancied I could cut it with the finest edged tool.&nbsp; The
howling of the winds in the cwms and dingles which run down the
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>mountain
on every side was really appalling.&nbsp; Indeed, the prospect
was horrible to contemplate.&nbsp; It gave an idea, says a writer
on the subject, of numbers of abysses concealed by a thick smoke
furiously circulating around us.&nbsp; Now and then, however, a
strong gust of wind created an opening in the mist, which, for a
moment, gave me a magnificent prospect of sea and lake, of deep
chasms, and high and lofty mountains, of almost fathomless
dingles and ravines; while towns and hamlets appeared in the
distance like small specks on the surface of the earth.&nbsp; But
the prospect was only momentary.&nbsp; The clouds of mist which
were rent asunder by the strong current of wind would, in the
twinkling of an eye, again form and unite, and thus present a
compact and complete whole, leaving me involved in a darkness
that might be felt.&nbsp; In a minute it would again separate
into a thousand parts, and fly in wild eddies up the gullies and
dingles, thus affording me another opportunity of seeing the Isle
of Mona, the mountain of Plynlimmon, Hell&rsquo;s Mouth, the
Iraeth Bach, and that magnificent bay which <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>once formed
the rich and fertile plain of Cantref-y-Gwaelod, with its sixteen
fortified cities and towns, whose inhabitants met with a watery
grave through the drunkenness of Seithenyn, who is styled in the
&ldquo;Triads&rdquo; as one of the three notorious drunkards of
the isle of Britain.&nbsp; Contemplating the scene so strange,
yet so grand, the following lines of the poet Rogers struck me as
extremely applicable to my then situation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
morning air<br />
Plays on my cheek, how gently, flinging round<br />
A silvery gleam; and now the purple mists<br />
Rise like a curtain; now the sun looks out,<br />
Filling, o&rsquo;erflowing with his glorious light,<br />
This noble amphitheatre of hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After spending nearly two hours on the summit in gazing upon
the wild, yet the grand and majestic scene presented to my view,
I felt, as I had to walk to Pont Aberglaslyn, and back to
Penygwryd, a distance of nearly twenty miles, that I dare not
delay my departure longer; hence I made instant preparation to
descend.&nbsp; I, however, left this Alpine top, and bade
farewell to old Snowdon, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>with feelings of deep sorrow and
poignant grief.&nbsp; On leaving this most prominent historic
spot in the past history of my country, I could not but enter
into the deep feeling of reverence with which my forefathers
regarded this mountain and its adjacent hills, valleys, and
plains.&nbsp; Thought I to myself, was it a wonder that they
almost worshipped Yr Wyddfa?&nbsp; Indeed they had every reason
for paying honour and homage to it.&nbsp; To them it had ever
been a never-failing friend&mdash;a sure and safe retreat when
they suffered and sustained defeat in battle.&nbsp; To them it
afforded a rich and never-failing refuge, in which they lodged
the young and the feeble and the non-combatants when they went
forth to fight the common foe&mdash;the implacable enemies of
their dear fatherland&mdash;foes and enemies, too, who were
strangers to generosity, but who loved conquest for the sake of
conquest, and who were alike indifferent to the sacrifice of
human blood as they were to English treasures.&nbsp; When they
followed our brave and heroic countrymen into the mountain
fastnesses of Snowdon, they generally suffered <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>terrible
slaughter, and repented having left those fortresses and plains
where they so much loved to dwell.&nbsp; Considering the many and
the terrible disasters which befell their marches in its
fastnesses, no wonder they preferred residing at some distance
removed from so impregnable a refuge.&nbsp; To the Welsh warriors
it had been a natural guardian angel: hence the reason why they
loved it so deeply, so ardently, and with the whole passion of
the soul.</p>
<p>After I had descended some distance towards Beddgelert, I
turned in order to take a parting farewell-look of this the
mother of Cambrian mountains; and in viewing its high and lofty
summit, now almost wholly enveloped in mist, I was forcibly
struck with the wild, dreary, and boundless scene.&nbsp; From the
point on which I stood this ancient hill appeared to be untrodden
by human foot, and tenanted only by wandering sheep and goats,
except the hoarse-croaking ravens.&nbsp; It was, indeed, sublime
to stand, as I stood then, on that spot, and commune with
solitude around&mdash;to gaze upon Snowdon and her manifold
adjacent <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>hills, slumbering calmly beneath me.&nbsp; With me there
was no form, no human being, no living thing; but I rejoiced that
there, amid this stupendous scene, I could commune freely and
uninterruptedly with nature and nature&rsquo;s God, and with the
spirits of my brave and heroic forefathers, whose bones lie
buried in that wild and dreary scene; and, as I finally parted
from the scene, I sang the following well-known lines, and so my
voice re-echoed through the dales and caverns:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rest, ye brave dead, &rsquo;midst the hills
of your sires.<br />
Oh, who would not slumber when Freedom expires?<br />
Lonely and voiceless your halls must remain,<br />
The children of song may not breathe in the chain.&rdquo;</p>

STORY OF DUNRAVEN CASTLE IN THE OLDEN TIMES;<br />
OR,<br />
GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT AGAINST WRECKERS.</h2>
<h3>THE PROEM.</h3>
<p>On the southern coast of the county of Glamorgan, and situate
at the back of a high rocky promontory commanding a magnificent
view of the Bristol Channel, and just opposite the little
sea-bathing village of Southerndown, which appears desolate amid
its desolation, stands the modern Castle of Dunraven, which was
built by the late Mr. Thomas Wyndham.&nbsp; This castle is
erected on the site of a very ancient structure, which, in the
olden times, was called Dindryfan.&nbsp; The old castle is in
some respects the most interesting in the Principality.&nbsp; It
was there one of Cambria&rsquo;s greatest warriors and one of her
purest patriots lived and reigned.&nbsp; Dunraven was the centre
of those wonderful <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>military movements which gained for their author
wide-spread fame and imperishable renown.&nbsp; It was there that
the great commander and war-tactician delivered those eloquent
harangues, which not only inspired confidence in so great and
skilful a leader, but also nerved the patriot&rsquo;s arm,
enabling his trusty followers to go forth to meet the foe
fearlessly, courageously, and with a resolute resolve to conquer
or to die for their country&rsquo;s welfare and the independence
of their fatherland.&nbsp; Caractacus, or as he is generally
called by Cambrian writers, Caraddwg, was a great man and an
illustrious warrior, celebrated no less for his heroism than for
his many other virtues.&nbsp; Hence, when one visits Dunraven,
the scenes of his childhood and riper years, one seems to imbibe
his spirit, to be inspired with the highest admiration for his
genius, and to feel the profoundest reverence for the man who,
though vanquished in his encounter with the well-disciplined
forces of Octavius yet was not ashamed&mdash;rather in it did he
glory&mdash;after many years of exile from the land of his birth,
of his love, and of his <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>deepest and fondest affection, to
return to the very scenes of his childhood and princely rule, in
order to proclaim the good news of the gospel, the truths and
glories of which he had learned and realized during his residence
in the far-famed city of Rome.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the death of Caraddwg, Dunraven continued to be
the seat of the Reguli of Glamorgan until the Norman
Conquest.&nbsp; When Robert Fitz-Hamon divided the country he and
his armies had conquered, he assigned this castle and manor to
William de Londres, who, in consequence of their worthless value,
gave them to his butler, afterwards Sir Arnold Butler.&nbsp; When
the male issue of the Butler family became extinct, the castle
and manor fell to Walter Vaughan, who was a descendant of the
female branch of the Butlers.&nbsp; It is to this person our
story relates.&nbsp; Oh that his crimes had never been recorded
by the pen of the historian!&nbsp; Oh that his life and its deeds
of horror and loathing, which, when we contemplate, makes
one&rsquo;s blood run cold, had remained unwritten!&nbsp; As,
however, these have been <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>handed down to this distant age, I
will endeavour to depict the scene, though I can form but a very
dim and hazy conception of the barbarities and cruelties
practised by that evil man in those distant times.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>CHAPTER I.<br />
<i>THE LOVERS</i>.</h3>
<p>It was a lovely autumn evening, when a young man and young
woman might have been seen walking hand in hand along the
carriage drive which led from the village of St. Bride&rsquo;s to
Dunraven Castle.&nbsp; The young man was in his usual buoyant and
cheerful mood, happy and joyous, but his companion was pensive
and sad.&nbsp; From childhood John ap William and Myfanwy
Gwenllian had been companions.&nbsp; In childhood they had
pledged themselves to be true to each other.&nbsp; In childhood
they had walked together, day after day, either on the rocky
headland below the village of Southerndown, or on the sands of
Dunraven Bay, picking off the rocks flowers of various tints and
hues, or gathering in the little haven or bay beautiful stones or
pebbles, or seaweeds and shells.&nbsp; Besides, during those
childish excursions <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>they were often seen gazing on the ocean surges, or on
the bright blue waves, now almost quiet and still, now dashing up
in awful and appalling fury against the high and stupendous rocks
surrounding the bay.&nbsp; Often, too, might they have been seen
watching the ships as they sailed up and down the channel.&nbsp;
John especially, loved the sea and its pebbly shore.&nbsp; He was
never so happy as when, with his beloved Myfanwy, he was watching
the tidal eddies, or viewing the frail barques as they rode so
majestically o&rsquo;er the briny waves, carrying in their laps,
as it were, the merchandise and the wealth of the world&mdash;the
products of the earth&rsquo;s richest blessings from shore to
shore and from clime to clime.&nbsp; John contemplated this scene
as a Christian philosopher.&nbsp; He looked upon commerce between
nation and nation and between peoples and peoples as one of the
greatest agents in advancing the world&rsquo;s civilization, as
it necessarily carried to distant lands those products of
industry which so much contribute towards the comfort and the
material happiness and the general welfare of the race.&nbsp; But
while <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>he
looked upon commercial enterprise as a channel through which
material blessings might be conveyed, he moreover regarded it as
tending directly to unite nation with nation, to realize and
cement in the bonds of a holy brotherhood different races and
separate nations and kingdoms; thus rendering war almost
impossible.&nbsp; Happy would it be if the statesmen of the world
would act up to these high principles!</p>
<p>Besides, though John had never been from home&mdash;Bridgend
being the furthest extent within the range of his geographical
knowledge&mdash;nevertheless, from his reflection on the
beneficial results flowing from commercial enterprise, and his
strong passion for a roving life, and being, moreover, desirous
to follow his father&rsquo;s profession, who was commander of a
merchant vessel, he had resolved, in his early years, to go to
sea when he grew old enough, if a favourable opportunity offered
itself.&nbsp; Myfanwy, however, used all her powers of argument
and suasion with a view to prevent him from following so
hazardous a calling; but without success.&nbsp; Upon a seafaring
life he was resolved.&nbsp; To <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>visit distant lands, and to behold
strange peoples and countries, was the all-prevailing and the
constant desire of his heart&rsquo;s deepest emotion.&nbsp; Hence
on attaining his thirteenth year, he was apprenticed to his
father.&nbsp; When, however, the day arrived for leaving home,
and for bidding adieu to his beloved mother and his darling
Myfanwy, the grief he felt on parting with those he so deeply and
tenderly loved, almost broke his heart.&nbsp; At last he tore
himself from their embraces and fond caresses, and on the
following day he joined his father&rsquo;s ship at Bristol, which
was even then a city of considerable commercial importance.</p>
<p>As young ap William was a joyous and spirited boy, always full
of fun and joviality, and was never so well pleased as when he
collected around him a number of the sailors, and told them tales
of other times, especially tales connected with the lives of the
great warriors and heroes of his country he, in consequence,
became a great favourite with his father&rsquo;s crew, who loved
him for his own and his father&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; During this
time he did not, however, neglect his studies; nor <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>was he
lacking in acquiring a thorough knowledge of his
profession.&nbsp; He studied navigation, paid great attention to
charts; while in a short time he gained such an intimate
acquaintance with the management of the vessel, that before two
years elapsed the chief mate pronounced him to be the best and
ablest sailor on board.</p>
<p>Before he attained his eighteenth year he could steer and
manage a vessel with any captain in the mercantile marine; and as
the first mate then retired from the service, John was appointed,
by the owners of the ship, as his successor, with a promise that
on the first vacancy he should have the command of one of their
largest vessels.&nbsp; During those years John had saved several
hundred pounds.&nbsp; This sum his father invested in the
purchase of a small freehold estate in his native parish, to
which John intended to retire after he had saved enough to secure
a sufficient competency for himself and his beloved
Myfanwy.&nbsp; To that day he looked forward with feelings of
longing anticipation.&nbsp; On that day he had often said he
would forget the past, would recall to his mind <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>neither
sorrow nor human woes; but would for once live a day wholly
devoted to pleasure and to joy, looking on from then to a still
more bright and happy future.&nbsp; Alas! alas! how different
often are results from our expectations.&nbsp; Weeping cometh in
the morning as well as at night.&nbsp; When we are most bent on
pleasure, when we fancy we are about to realize, according to our
anticipations, its fullest fruition, a dark cloud, charged with
mournful tidings, bursts on our head.&nbsp; The day on which he
led Myfanwy to the altar was the day on which he himself became
an orphan.&nbsp; Indeed, he had not left the churchyard before
being apprised of the sad intelligence that a father whom he
loved so much was now a mangled corpse.&nbsp; He went home to
weep and to grieve, though he did not sorrow as one who had no
hope.</p>
<h3><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<i>A NOBLE RESOLVE NOBLY CARRIED OUT</i>.</h3>
<p>It was morning.&nbsp; Walter Vaughan and his heir were
partaking of an early meal before going to the chase.&nbsp; Just
previous to their departure, &ldquo;faithful Evan,&rdquo; as he
was called by the neighbours, entered the hall, and handed his
master a letter, which he received with a trembling hand.&nbsp;
Mr. Vaughan hastily broke the seal, and commenced perusing its
contents, but before he had concluded its perusal, he became as
pale as death, he shook like an aspen leaf, and his hand trembled
violently.&nbsp; The young lord, seeing his father&rsquo;s
distress and mental agony, became seriously alarmed, and, in a
paroxysm of anguish and grief, exclaimed in weeping
tones:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, my dear and fond parent! what is the
matter?&nbsp; Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; replied the lord, &ldquo;I am a ruined
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Ruined, did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, completely and, I fear, irretrievably
ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, and by what means has so great a calamity befallen
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I will explain in a few words.&nbsp; Some time ago
I placed my affairs in the hands of an attorney, whom I then
believed to be an honest man.&nbsp; He has, however, proved
himself to be a faithless friend and an arrant rogue.&nbsp; This
is his letter, in which he informs me that the lawsuit has been
decided in favour of my opponent, who is my bitterest foe.&nbsp;
This vagabond lawyer further tells me, that the costs are so
enormous that I shall be compelled to sell my estates in order to
meet the liability.&nbsp; He even doubts whether the castle and
manor of Dunraven will realize sufficient, over and above the
present encumbrance, to meet the debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you need not, dear father, dispose of the estate to
satisfy the claims of these lawyers.&nbsp; There is the twenty
thousand pounds my uncle left me in the bank.&nbsp; I will send
an authority <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>to the manager to pay you that sum.&nbsp; Surely, that
will be sufficient to meet all claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear and noble-hearted boy, it almost breaks my
heart to be obliged to tell you that your money, even to the last
shilling, has already been spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, you have not raised the whole of that
sum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every penny has gone; and now, dear Walter, your
patrimony in a few weeks will, I fear, become the possession of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is sad news, my father,&rdquo; replied Walter
junior.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is, indeed, a terrible disaster.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t grieve.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be
undone.&nbsp; I am resolved yet to redeem it, if time be granted
me.&nbsp; I am now penniless; but I will make my own
fortune.&nbsp; I will yet gain for myself a name and a rank which
shall be equal to, if it does not surpass, that of my illustrious
ancestors.&nbsp; Now being bereft of all, the poorest of the
poor, and dependent upon my own powers and will, I will repair
the ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what means will you accomplish this, Walter?&rdquo;
inquired the father.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;Oh, father, by means which are honourable; and by
pursuits which lead to fortune.&nbsp; By work, by labour, by
industry, by indomitable plodding, and by engaging in the calling
of men who have thereby accumulated untold wealth, and are
possessed of unbounded riches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, my son, understand you.&nbsp; To what pursuit
do you refer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be plain, then, this is my resolve: to engage at
once in commercial undertakings, thus following in the footsteps
of my late lamented uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, considering the position we occupy in society as
the lords of Dunraven, for you to enter upon such an undertaking
would be a degradation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father, is it not a greater degradation to be
poor&mdash;to see our lands in the possession of others, to be
provided with bread by the toil and labour of others&mdash;in
short, to see men work, while we refuse to lift up a hand to help
them, when we are dependent upon their industry?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;It is hard to do this, my noble boy; but to me it
is still more painful to part with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, dear father, have ever been kind and indulgent to
me.&nbsp; Believe me, for I speak from my heart of hearts, that
to leave you, though it be but for a season, is to me a matter of
deep sorrow.&nbsp; It is, however, a stern necessity that compels
my departure.&nbsp; I shall, nevertheless, leave you, though with
sadness, yet with a buoyant hope, destined, I doubt not to be
realised, to return to the home of my fathers laden with
gold.&nbsp; The prospect of that day will cheer me in my labour,
will nerve my arm, and help me to surmount any difficulties which
may pass athwart my path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant you success, my son, for which I will pray
fervently during your forced absence.&nbsp; But whither will you
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, dear father, that I can secure immediate
employment&mdash;an employment, too, which will in no way be
degrading to me as your heir.&nbsp; Yesterday I received a letter
from my old friend and companion, Mr. Jones, of Marseilles, who
is one of the greatest merchants of that famous <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>city, in
which he has asked me to look out for a gentleman to act as
confidential clerk.&nbsp; He further says, that if the right man
secures the appointment, and proves to be one who can be trusted,
with business habits, tact, and energy, he holds out the prospect
of an advantageous partnership.&nbsp; As he is in immediate want
of a young man possessing those qualities, which I fancy I
possess, I will write him offering my services, which,
considering my altered circumstances, I think he will only feel
too proud to accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Walter was indeed just the kind of youth Mr. Jones
wanted.&nbsp; He had received the best education which the Oxford
of those times afforded.&nbsp; He had the bump of order largely
developed.&nbsp; He was persevering, painstaking, energetic, and
an indomitable plodder; whatever his hand found to do, he did it
with all his might.&nbsp; Anything he undertook he would not give
up until he had thoroughly mastered it.&nbsp; Moreover, he was
thoroughly conscientious.&nbsp; In this virtue he followed his
mother&rsquo;s rather than his father&rsquo;s family.&nbsp;
Indeed, the old lord was <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>regarded, and was justly considered,
as an unprincipled, grasping, and unscrupulous man; and it was
his greedy love of gold, and his insatiable thirst for larger
possessions, which he sought to secure by unjust means and foul
play, that had, in consequence of non-success, brought about his
ruin.&nbsp; He had set up a claim to the heirship of another
gentleman&rsquo;s estate, though its owner&rsquo;s ancestors were
in its possession and enjoyment when Vaughan&rsquo;s forefathers
were menials.&nbsp; The court, happily, decided the suit in
favour of the rightful owner, and to mark their sense of the
wrong the lord of Dunraven intended doing, ordered him to pay the
costs of ten years&rsquo; litigation.&nbsp; It was this final
decision of which his lawyer had apprised him in the letter
previously alluded to.&nbsp; His son, on the other hand, was an
upright and an honourable man, who would rather suffer wrong than
do an unjust act.&nbsp; Mr. Jones was well aware of these noble
qualities with which young Walter was endowed; hence, on the
receipt of the letter offering his services, he wrote him a note
full of kindly feeling and sympathy, and further <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>pressing his
old friend and correspondent to join him in London the following
week, as he should be over in England for a few days on important
matters connected with his business.&nbsp; On the receipt of this
communication from Mr. Jones, young Walter commenced preparing
for leaving home.&nbsp; At last the day arrived for his
departure, and bidding his father an affectionate adieu, he went
forth into the broad world, either to be carried on the tide
which leads to fortune, or to sink beneath its devouring
crests.</p>
<p>On Walter&rsquo;s arrival in London, his old friend and
earliest companion was waiting at his hotel ready to receive
him.&nbsp; His reception was most cordial on the part of Mr.
Jones.&nbsp; After spending a few days in town, they took ship
for Marseilles.&nbsp; On arriving at their destination, the heir
of Dunraven was at once installed in office; and before a week
had elapsed, his employer saw that he had secured a valuable
acquisition to his establishment.</p>
<p>After Mr. Vaughan had been in the establishment about six
months, Mr. Jones came to the office one morning earlier than
usual.&nbsp; Though <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>none of the hands had arrived, he found to his surprise
and joy his new clerk at the desk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo;
addressing Walter, &ldquo;you are here, for I want to consult you
on a matter of great importance.&nbsp; I have been debating with
my junior partner,&rdquo; continued Mr. Jones, &ldquo;as to the
wisdom or unwisdom of sending to the London market a new kind of
silk, which a manufacturer has just introduced.&nbsp; He strongly
opposes its purchase, while I, on the other hand, am convinced it
is just the thing that will take.&nbsp; You are a good judge of
quality and beauty, so give me your candid opinion as to whether
it is wise or not to make a large or any purchase of this class
of goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you will not require an immediate
answer,&rdquo; replied Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you will kindly
give me an hour to think over it, I will then offer my
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During that hour the young clerk was busily engaged in
carefully examining the material with the aid of a powerful
magnifying glass, and was struck with both the fineness of the
texture and the beauty of its design.&nbsp; On the return of his
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>principal,
he said that, in his opinion, the silk was just the kind of goods
which would command a ready sale in the London market, and
strongly recommended that the whole stock should be bought up,
and immediately shipped.&nbsp; Mr. Jones acted on the opinion,
which turned out to be the most fortunate speculation in which he
had ever engaged.&nbsp; The sum actually realized was
&pound;20,000, of this sum he presented the young clerk with
&pound;5000, and in addition offered&mdash;an offer which was
gladly and gratefully accepted&mdash;a partnership in the
business.&nbsp; After this, the house of Jones &amp; Company rose
higher and higher in the commercial world, and the annual profits
of the business were so great, that at the expiration of the
seven years of partnership the young lord of Dunraven had at his
command a sufficient sum to pay off the incumbrance of the
estate.&nbsp; To that effect he wrote his father, and on the
receipt of the money, he called his creditors together and paid
them their demands.&nbsp; The lord of Dunraven thus became once
more a free and independent man; but, alas! he did not give up
his calling, but, <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>with new life and renewed energy pursued the mission of
the Evil One: being constantly at the post of mischief, and with
eager eyes and a longing heart, looking out on the stormy wavy
channel for treasures which, by foul play, he was resolved to
bring into his meshes.&nbsp; Prosper thou, lord of Dunraven, but
in thy prosperity remember that the sword of justice is hovering
over thy head, and in the midst of thy prosperity it will strike
thee down.&nbsp; The day of vengeance tarries; but it will come,
and when it arrives, oh, how terrible will be thy doom!</p>

42</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<i>THE ALLIANCE OF THE LORD OF DUNRAVEN WITH MAC THE DEVIL</i>,
<i>AND SOME OFITS RESULTS</i>.</h3>
<p>It was about three years subsequent to the departure of the
son and heir of Dunraven, that the old lord resolved to take into
his service MacLean, <i>alias</i> Mac the Devil.&nbsp; He knew
that this man was a desperate character and a thorough daredevil,
who neither feared God nor regarded man; in short, that for money
and Scotch whisky, he would do the devil&rsquo;s work according
to his satanic majesty&rsquo;s own special plan.&nbsp; There was
no crime of which Mac was not guilty, but, by reason of the
stealthy way in which he carried out his doings of iniquity, he
always succeeded in avoiding detection.&nbsp; Though blood was on
his hands, though he had robbed the fatherless, and murdered, for
the sake of pelf, the innocent, yet he walked the earth with head
erect as a guiltless person, little <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>dreaming of the terrible doom
awaiting him.&nbsp; However, his cup of iniquity was not yet
full, though daily it was nearing the brim.&nbsp; He was in the
act of planning some new crime when he received a message from
the lord of Dunraven to attend him at the castle.&nbsp; Mac, with
trembling hands and a sinking heart, at once attended to the
commands of Mr. Vaughan, though, on his way there, he had many
misgivings as to the prudence of the step he was taking.&nbsp;
He, however, soon convinced himself that were he to disobey the
summons he must quit for ever the neighbourhood, as he dare not
confront the lord of Dunraven if guilty of disobedience to his
lordship&rsquo;s commands.&nbsp; To the castle, therefore, he
repaired, and on his arrival he was ushered by the faithful Evan
into the library, where Mr. Vaughan was awaiting him.&nbsp; On
Mac&rsquo;s entering he was requested to take a seat, when Mr.
Vaughan, with a degree of sternness he seldom manifested,
reproached him for leading a life so fraught with danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, my lord,&rdquo; said Mac, touching his head,
&ldquo;understand your meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; If
then I say you are deeply steeped in crime, that you are a
murderer, a thief, a rogue, and a villain, should I not speak the
truth, and would you not understand my charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying so, and proving its truth, are, I ken, two very
different things, my lord.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t prove that I am
otherwise than an innocent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be too sure of that, Mac.&nbsp; Indeed,
I already possess evidence, which, if necessary, can at any
moment be produced, completely substantiating my charge; and,
Mac, I have a great mind to produce that evidence to the
authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare not do that, my lord,&rdquo; replied Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel! dare you threaten me in my own
castle?&nbsp; If you say another word, and use that language to
me, I&rsquo;ll send for the bum-bailiff at once, and, as a
magistrate, order you into his custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say again, my lord, that you daren&rsquo;t carry out
your threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;Why daren&rsquo;t I, I should be glad to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if you were to do so I&rsquo;d
peach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would do what, Mac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d peach; that is, I&rsquo;d tell all about your
lordship&rsquo;s doings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be d&mdash;d, you would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who would believe you, you scoundrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me they may not, my lord of Dunraven; but they&rsquo;d
believe the evidence of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you or your friends, you vagabond, bear any
evil testimony against me?&nbsp; I live in my own castle, and
never mix with the world.&nbsp; It is well known to all around,
that my life and my time is devoted to study, to the practice of
virtue, and to acts of piety.&nbsp; Me they know as a model
citizen and a Christian man and a gentleman.&nbsp; Therefore, my
character would be proof against insinuations, or charges patched
up by you or your hellish crew.&nbsp; You and your criminal
companions might say, and even swear&mdash;you are capable of
anything bad&mdash;you saw me in the act of committing a crime,
but neither your word nor your oath would have any weight <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>with those
who know you, were the life of a dog only involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna you be too sure of that, my lord,&rdquo; rejoined
Mac; &ldquo;I ken, and Squire Jones knows too, the sad fate of
the ship <i>Bristol</i>, of the <i>Elizabeth</i> of Swansea, and
of the <i>City of Paris</i>.&nbsp; He and I know also by whose
hands the false light was hung out on Dunraven Head, and by whose
hands the captains and the crews were murdered&mdash;who
afterwards seized the wrecks, who sent them to market to be sold,
and who received the money.&nbsp; If I may be so bold, I could
tell further that, within this castle, and in a cell beneath this
room, there is a poor unfortunate man, who was put into an iron
cage, and locked there by you,&mdash;the lord of Dunraven
castle,&mdash;and that he is daily fed by crumbs from your
table.&nbsp; If this man were free, he could tell a tale at which
humanity would shudder.&nbsp; You, my lord, think I sleep with my
eyes shut, that I tremble at sight of the sea, that I&rsquo;m
afraid of the darkness and the tempests; and you knew not that
when those vessels went down, and when all the hands on board
perished, except this <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>poor man in the cage, I was near you,
my lord,&mdash;even close by your side, though unperceived.&nbsp;
Knowing these facts, I now dare you, my lord, to molest me or
breathe a word injurious to my character.&nbsp; If you do so,
I&rsquo;ll peach, and I&rsquo;ll take care that the lord of
Dunraven shall be my fellow-prisoner.&nbsp; You have called me a
scoundrel.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t that foul term apply equally to
you, my lord?&nbsp; But your sin will yet find you
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For these terrible revelations Mr. Vaughan was wholly
unprepared.&nbsp; During their recital he shook as a man having
the palsy.&nbsp; He uttered, too, the most awful imprecations,
and cursed and swore like a man possessed of the devil.&nbsp;
These, however, had no influence over the mind of the hard-headed
and hard-hearted Scotchman, who continued his tale heedless of
the foaming rage of Mr. Vaughan.&nbsp; <i>He</i> never dreamt
that his crimes were known to mortal, beyond the circle of his
demoniac companions.&nbsp; He had so cautiously arranged his
plans, and had carried them out so stealthily, that he fancied
the knowledge of his rascality was confined to those desperadoes
whom he had specially hired to carry <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>out his nefarious designs.&nbsp; Now,
however, his deeds were known not only to Mac, but to his great
enemy, Squire Jones; thus the man whom he sought to rob of his
rightful possessions was also cognizant of those deeds.&nbsp; Mr.
Vaughan&rsquo;s first thought, when Mac had finished his tale,
was to take away, there and then, either his life or his
liberty.&nbsp; But a moment&rsquo;s reflection compelled him to
hesitate in adopting so dangerous a course, as it was known in
the village of Southerndown that Mac had been summoned to the
castle.&nbsp; Considering the matter more seriously, he came to
the conclusion that there was only one course open to him:
namely, to take Mac into his service, and make him captain of the
crew.&nbsp; By pursuing this course, he would completely shut the
mouths of Mac&rsquo;s friends, and by securing the services of so
skilful and so daring a wrecker, richer and more abundant
harvests might yet be reaped.&nbsp; Drawing himself to his full
height, he said to his defiant visitor,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, Mac, admit your charges, and I say further
that they are incapable of proof; but as I sustained so heavy a
loss by law, and <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>as drowning men will not stand on ceremony, but will
accept the assistance of their bitterest foe when they feel
themselves sinking beneath the devouring waves, I am therefore
prepared to take you into my employ, and if you prove faithful to
my interests and obedient to my orders, you may rise to wealth
and to honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in what way, my lord, do you intend me to serve
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Mac, your special calling, and not wholly
unknown to me,&mdash;don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&mdash;is the success
which has followed your labours.&nbsp; Being under my protection,
by being in my service, you may well look forward to still
greater results.&nbsp; I need not say you are well aware that
your present position is fraught with danger, and that one word
from me would put a stop to your career.&nbsp; If your words be
true, <i>our</i> interests clash.&nbsp; Besides, Mac, the
stealthy and criminal vagabond, prowling about in search of prey,
is in a very different position to Mac, the servant of the lord
of Dunraven.&nbsp; With that sentiment you agree, do you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;I must admit, my lord, you have put the case very
clearly, and your reasons in favour of my accepting your offer
are strong.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t withstand them, so I&rsquo;ll say
Aye to your proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have acted like a man of sense, Mac, as I always
took you to be.&nbsp; To-night, work will have to be done; so go
home and tell Molly, your wife, of your engagement, and
don&rsquo;t fail to meet me at the Watch Tower at four
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had Mac left the castle to pay a visit to his wife,
with a view to apprise her of his engagement, than Mr. Vaughan
also took his departure, and immediately afterwards joined the
watcher at the Tower, which was situate on the highest point of
the promontory.&nbsp; On entering the observatory, he inquired
for the result of the day&rsquo;s observations, which, on being
put into his hand, made him remark that matters did not look very
bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When things are at the worst,&rdquo; replied the
watcher, &ldquo;they generally mend.&nbsp; I think we shall have
some work to do before to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Your reason for that opinion, my faithful
Duncan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see yonder flag hoisted on St. Donat&rsquo;s Watch
Tower?&nbsp; That flag has never yet deceived me.&nbsp; Depend
upon it, it is the harbinger of good news.&nbsp; The wind, too,
blows hard from the south, and, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, there
will be a fearful gale before midnight, and the ships coming down
channel must necessarily be driven towards our coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your information, my Duncan, is cheering: I, too, am
bearer of good news to you.&nbsp; I have just engaged Mac the
Devil, and shall appoint him to the office of captain of the
beach and boatmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve taken my cousin into
your service.&nbsp; Mac is a smart man, he is well up in the
trade, he is fearless, and, what is still more important, will
not stick at trifles in obtaining his end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You approve then, Duncan, of my arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly, sir.&nbsp; In our line of business Mac
has no equal.&nbsp; He has the strength <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of a giant,
while he is a stranger to fear, and fortunately has no
conscience.&nbsp; I never heard of his failure in accomplishing
his object by fair means or foul.&nbsp; When he fails to thrash a
dozen sailors with his fists, and to pitch them into the sea, he
resorts to the pistol, which, in his hand, never misses in its
aim.&nbsp; In our calling, my lord, I yield to none but
Mac.&nbsp; He is my superior in everything, except in this
observatory.&nbsp; Oh, were he here to-night!&nbsp; We shall want
a man of his metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time your wish will be gratified.&nbsp; I expect
Mac here every moment.&nbsp; Look, he&rsquo;s coming down the
road from Southerndown, in our direction.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;
*&nbsp; Call up the men from the beach, Duncan; I wish them to be
present when Mac arrives, so as to inform them of the
appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men were duly summoned by the head watcher.&nbsp; On
arriving at the tower, they stood in a row, in front of the
entrance, to await their master&rsquo;s commands.&nbsp; Presently
he appeared, accompanied by Duncan and Mac, and, addressing his
men, spoke of their fidelity to <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>his interest, called their attention
to the many splendid victories achieved over the enemy, of the
rich laurels already reaped from wrecks, and, further, that there
was the strongest ground for hoping that their past gains were
but as a drop of the bucket to those they might expect to realize
hereafter.&nbsp; &ldquo;But your success,&rdquo; said Mr.
Vaughan, &ldquo;will depend wholly upon yourselves.&nbsp; You
must be united, there must be harmony in your ranks, hearty
co-operation; while all must cheerfully bow to the order of the
commander-in-chief.&nbsp; To that office I have selected a man
after your own heart.&nbsp; You who are in favour of having Mac
for your captain, hold up your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this request every hand was held up, whereupon Mac took his
post at the head of the wreckers.&nbsp; They were then regaled
with a liberal supply of whisky, and when each one had taken his
fill they repaired again to the beach.&nbsp; No sooner, however,
had they departed than there were seen coming down the channel
two fine vessels.&nbsp; The wind now blew a frightful gale,
raising up the waters <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>into waves like mountains, on whose
crests the ships were carried at their mercy.&nbsp; Everything
appeared favourable to the wreckers.&nbsp; In the west the sun
had declined.&nbsp; The shades of night were falling fast.&nbsp;
Every minute the darkness thickened.&nbsp; The tempest increased
in fury, while the roar of the ocean and the winds howling in the
rocks and caverns around Dunraven Head, were most
appalling.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the tempest, neither Mr. Vaughan
nor Duncan moved from the spot of observation.&nbsp; As the
vessels neared the point, the fatal light was placed in the
tower.&nbsp; The captains of both ships now fully realised their
danger: that there was no hope of saving either their ships or
their own lives.&nbsp; The crews, too, were well aware of being
on the enemy&rsquo;s ground, and, informing their commanders of
their apprehension, at once unanimously resolved, if they must
perish by treachery so base and devilish, that others should also
perish at their hands.&nbsp; On their ships being driven into the
bay they heroically prepared themselves for the combat.&nbsp;
Each one <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>armed himself with a cutlass, and when the vessels were
dashed against the rocks of Dunraven Head, they, as one man,
leaped into the boiling surge, and swam for the shore.&nbsp; But
in this heroic attempt to save their lives, several received
severe injuries, while others sank to rise no more.&nbsp;
However, the greater portion of them arrived safely on the beach,
but no sooner had they landed than they saw, creeping along the
shore, under the shelter of the rocks, a strong body of men well
armed.&nbsp; The sailors, however, were in no way alarmed at the
appearance of the enemy.&nbsp; Before quitting their vessels they
were well aware that the lord of Dunraven was on the alert.&nbsp;
Of this the light on the Watch Tower was a sufficient
proof.&nbsp; Hence, when they saw the wreckers approaching they
placed themselves on the defensive, and patiently awaited the
attack.&nbsp; They had not long to wait, for the Dunraven men
immediately came up and called upon the sailors to
surrender.&nbsp; To that call, however, they paid no heed, but
drawing out their daggers, fell with terrible force upon <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the wreckers,
who, however, stood their ground manfully.&nbsp; The battle was a
desperate one, while the slaughter was most appalling to
witness.&nbsp; Many a brave man on both sides fell, mortally
wounded.&nbsp; For a time the sailors had the best of the
fray.&nbsp; Their arms were nerved, too, by the consideration
that, if beaten, death would be the lot of each.&nbsp; Just,
however, when they thought their victory was sure, there came up
to the rescue of the wreckers their captain, who, with his own
hand, killed six of the sailors.&nbsp; The work of butchery now
commenced in earnest.&nbsp; One after another of the sailors
fell, never to rise again.&nbsp; Indeed not one single man of
their number survived to tell the tale.&nbsp; When the work of
slaughter was completed, the captain ordered all the bodies to be
carried to the adjoining cavern, where they were buried in a
large chasm in the rock.&nbsp; After interring the dead, Mac and
the survivors returned to the beach, and watched there for the
morning dawn.&nbsp; During the night both vessels were broken to
atoms by the fury of the waves, and <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>as daylight appeared, the shore, for
half a mile, was literally covered with articles of great value,
which on being sold, realised a large sum.</p>
<p>The deeds of that terrible night spread far and wide.&nbsp;
The owners of the vessels and merchants pressed the Government to
send down a special commission of inquiry.&nbsp; For several
weeks these commissioners carried on their investigations; but,
while collecting a large amount of evidence, yet in consequence
of the absence of one witness, whose evidence was essential to
bring the charge home to the lord of Dunraven, they failed in
substantiating the case against Mr. Vaughan.&nbsp; A week
subsequent to the departure of the commissioners, that witness
was found; but he could tell no tale, being a mangled
corpse.&nbsp; The body had been washed ashore near
Porthcawl.&nbsp; The remains were those of Captain ap William,
the father of John.&nbsp; The news of this discovery was at once
carried to his widow, who was busily engaged in preparing her
son&rsquo;s wedding dinner when the messenger arrived.&nbsp;
After <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>breaking the fatal news to Mrs. ap William, the
messenger continued his journey to the little village of St.
Bride&rsquo;s, and, going up to the church, he met at the porch
the newly-married pair.&nbsp; To Captain John, as he was
generally called, the messenger told his sad tale.&nbsp; Both
John and his wife were deeply affected on being apprised of their
bereavement.&nbsp; They returned to their home to weep and to
mourn; so John&rsquo;s bridal day, which he hoped would be a day
of unclouded joy, proved to be one of sadness, of sorrow, and of
death.&nbsp; He thus fully realized, by personal experience, the
truth of the inspired saying, that we know not what a day may
bring forth.</p>
<h3><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<i>THE TERRIBLE DOOM</i>.</h3>
<p>During the progress of the inquiry into the circumstances
connected with the wreck, every effort was made by the
authorities to discover the whereabouts of those who were
believed to be engaged in the affair; but those inquiries were,
unfortunately, unattended with success.&nbsp; The usual haunts of
the wreckers were repeatedly searched, their dwellings were
watched, and even guarded night and day.&nbsp; The villages and
the neighbouring hamlets were visited on several consecutive
days, yet they failed to find a single individual able to afford
any intelligence or information as to the hiding-place of the
desperadoes.&nbsp; The non-success of these inquiries was
considered as most singular, no less than inexplicable.&nbsp; On
the morning following the sad occurrence, several of the
wreckers, including Mac the <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Devil, had been seen on the beach
below Dunraven Castle, but it appeared that no sooner had they
completed the packing and loading of the treasures collected,
than they all disappeared in a most sudden manner from view, and
that disappearance was effected in a most unaccountable
way.&nbsp; Whither they went, or how they left the beach, no one
could tell.&nbsp; They were distinctly seen, and in a moment
afterwards they were lost to view, as if the earth had opened and
swallowed them up.</p>
<p>Owing to their non-discovery, speculation was rife as to their
probable hiding-place.&nbsp; Some thought it most likely that
they were hidden in the cellars under Dunraven Castle; others
contended that Mr. Vaughan was too shrewd a man to place them
there, especially as he himself was suspected of participating in
the battle, and that that suspicion might lead to an inquiry
which might be followed up by a personal search.&nbsp; Others
concluded that they had quitted the neighbourhood, and were
hiding in the woods about Margam, or up the Ogmore Valley.&nbsp;
There was one old gentleman <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>who treated all these opinions with
contempt.&nbsp; Every village and parish has its wise man, to
whom, in an emergency, an appeal is made, and the old gentleman
alluded to was the then wise man of Southerndown, as Hopkin
Llewelyn is in our day.&nbsp; He gave it as his opinion, that the
wreckers were neither in the woods of Ogmore Valley nor Margam,
nor would they be found in the Dunraven cellars, but were still
in the neighbourhood, and within the sound of their voices; in
short, that they were hid in some subterraneous cavern in the
bay, which had hitherto remained undiscovered, and hence was
known only to the wreckers.&nbsp; He further predicted that as
soon as the storm should blow over, by the departure of the
commissioners, and the usual quietude of the locality assume its
general aspect, the wreckers would again return to their old
haunts, having Mac at their head; and would be then found
wandering from point to point, having no special occupation, nor
ostensible means of livelihood.&nbsp; The prediction of the
village seer was verified to the <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>letter.&nbsp; No sooner had the
commissioners left than the wreckers did return, and they
appeared at their place of rendezvous, the Cups, as if nothing
had happened.&nbsp; Here they spent the morning of each day in
drinking beer and whisky; and here they spent their money with as
much prodigality as if they were the owners of gold mines.&nbsp;
The landlord of the Cups received their money without even asking
whether they came to it by honest or lawless means.&nbsp; When
asked how he could be so lost to every sense of right as to
accept money from men who certainly had earned it by being
engaged in a nefarious calling, he replied that he was perfectly
indifferent, and that it was no concern of his how they came by
their silver and gold, so long as they paid him for what they
drank.&nbsp; In this reply we recognise the true philosophy of
the trade.&nbsp; Landlords, as a rule, care but little for the
sorrows, the poverty, and the wants of their drinking clients and
their families.&nbsp; They want to sell drink, and hence never
for a moment reflect whether or not their <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>customers can
afford to spend a shilling, or as to the manner by means of which
it was earned.&nbsp; He, of the Cups, was, in money matters, true
to his calling; but we cannot commend the wisdom, or rather
unwisdom, of the wreckers in spending their money at the old
house, when the children of some of them wanted bread.</p>
<p>On the morning following one of these carouses, Mac paid a
visit to the tower to see his cousin Duncan.&nbsp; Though they
had met several times since the day on which they came from their
hiding-places, yet they had not been fortunate enough to secure
an uninterrupted and unobserved conversation.&nbsp; To this both
had anxiously looked forward.&nbsp; Fortunately, when Mac
entered, ho found his cousin in the observatory alone.&nbsp;
Placing his books and instruments on the table, Duncan turned his
chair to the fire, and requested his visitor to be seated on the
opposite side of the fire.&nbsp; As the kettle was boiling on the
hob, the host prepared two pints of excellent whisky toddy, one
of which <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>he handed Mac, who, on sipping the mixture remarked that
it was &ldquo;capital stuff,&rdquo; and moreover inquired of
Duncan where he obtained it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came, Mac, from the old country; imported direct
from the distiller.&nbsp; This is just the beverage for a stormy
night, is it not, Mac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On <i>that night</i> I&rsquo;d have given a pound for a
pint of toddy like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the bye, Mac,&rdquo; said Duncan, &ldquo;you did the
thing very neatly that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged to you, cousin, for your good
opinion.&nbsp; What did Mr. Vaughan say about our doings?&nbsp;
He saw the whole scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord said to me, that unless you had been present,
all would have been lost, as the sailors up to the time you came
up had the best of the battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vaughan was right there, Duncan.&nbsp; Had I not
come up at the moment I did, every wrecker would have been a dead
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my lord, who was on the rock above you,
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;Oh, Duncan, it was a sad sight!&nbsp; I hope,
cousin, I shall never be compelled to witness a similar
scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sickening and a degrading calling, this of
ours, in which victory has no honour, and triumph no glory.&nbsp;
While it is a merry life and profitable to those engaged in it,
it is surrounded with scenes which are shocking to
behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our master has such a large estate, Duncan, why does
he carry on so hazardous and so dangerous a calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret is this, he loves gold, and his heart is set
on attaining riches; and to secure them he&rsquo;ll take away any
man&rsquo;s life if it stands between him and the prize he
covets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he shook in his shoes when those men
were down here.&nbsp; Was he not alarmed, Duncan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our master was, Mac, certainly alarmed; but, take my
word, he&rsquo;ll go on just in the same way.&nbsp; He is just
like the little animal which, when once it tastes the blood of
its victim, never gives up pursuit until it has secured the <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>prey.&nbsp;
The lord of Dunraven will, in my opinion, continue wrecking until
some great calamity befalls his house or his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subsequent doings of Mr. Vaughan fully established the
opinion of Duncan.&nbsp; Although he had been in imminent danger
of having his crime discovered, yet, when those who conducted the
inquiry had left the vicinity, the lord of Dunraven, with renewed
energy and more resolute determination, carried on his nefarious
calling.&nbsp; In each succeeding winter, vessels were wrecked in
Dunraven Bay which had been decoyed thither by the false lights
he had caused to be placed in the tower.&nbsp; From these wrecks
he realized large sums.&nbsp; Had he been permitted to pursue his
satanic designs for a few years longer, he would have become the
richest man in the vale of Glamorgan.</p>
<p>In consequence of the great losses ship-owners had sustained
by reason of these wrecks, and the terror which the scenes of
Dunraven had inspired, both owners and masters of vessels trading
up and down the <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Bristol Channel were alarmed, and were in constant
apprehensions lest they should experience the same disaster which
had unhappily befallen so many of their brethren.&nbsp; Captain
ap William, however, was not deterred from pursuing his seafaring
calling by these disasters, though his wife, previously to his
starting on every voyage, warned him of the danger of following
so hazardous a pursuit.&nbsp; Yet, in spite of those warnings,
and the urgent solicitations of his wife to remain at home, he
continued going to sea.</p>
<p>It was after one of these wrecks, when more than ordinary
violence had been used by the men of Dunraven, that the captain
and his wife were walking from St. Bride&rsquo;s along the
carriage way to Dunraven.&nbsp; This was their favourite walk,
and it was, moreover, associated with many a happy scene in days
of yore.&nbsp; After pursuing their walk for some time in
silence, Mrs. ap William began to weep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why those tears, Myfanwy?&rdquo; asked her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I weep, John,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;in thought <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>of the
prospect of our separation.&nbsp; Oh, you will not leave me
again, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, wife, I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the necessity for you to risk your life
again?&nbsp; We have enough to keep us in independence and
comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised my employers to go on this one
voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they get another captain to take charge of
the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless they could, but they won&rsquo;t trust every
man with my vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you would stay at home!&nbsp; Indeed,
indeed, I fear, if you leave me, I shall never see you
again.&nbsp; Last night I dreamt, and in my dream I fancied I saw
your body being taken from the sea, your hair clotted, and your
face covered with blood.&nbsp; Oh, I do fear, if you again leave
me, I shall never see you alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed for my safety, Myfanwy.&nbsp; Life is
as safe on the ocean as on the land.&nbsp; The same Providence
watches over the seaman as the landsman.&nbsp; He being at the
helm, He <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>controlling and guiding the destiny of us all, will be
my friend, even should danger threaten me.&nbsp; So cheer up,
thou treasure of my heart, and since you are so urgent that I
should give up my calling, I now promise that on my return from
this one voyage I will remain at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can urge you no further, John.&nbsp; During your
absence I&rsquo;ll pray for your safe return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning Captain John ap William took his
departure.&nbsp; He joined his ship at Bristol, and from that
port he sailed for the city of Lisbon with a cargo of West of
England goods.&nbsp; From thence he sailed to London, thence to
Hamburg, and after several voyages between the two last-mentioned
cities, chartered his ship to the Mediterranean, and took a
valuable cargo at Marseilles for Bristol.</p>
<p>During her husband&rsquo;s absence, Myfanwy felt constant
anxiety on his behalf, an anxiety intensified owing to the sad
havoc among shipping at Dunraven Bay.&nbsp; As it was now winter,
her feeling of apprehension increased <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>in intensity, as she daily expected
his return.&nbsp; October had come and gone, but he had not
returned, nor had she received, for several weeks, a letter from
him.&nbsp; November had come in more than usually stormy.&nbsp;
All over the country trees had been uprooted, houses were blown
down, and on the rocks above Dunraven Bay, and below
Southerndown, the winds were so terrible that persons were in the
imminent risk of being blown over if they went within even fifty
yards of the precipice.&nbsp; On Friday morning the hurricane
increased in its fury.&nbsp; As the evening approached, the storm
became fearful, while the tumultuous waves increased in violence,
foaming, then wildly raving, then receding in circling eddies for
awhile, into their gloomy bosom; then, again, returning with
renewed force and augmented fury.&nbsp; Upon their tumultuous and
angry surges a large vessel, heavily laden, was being driven
towards the bay of Dunraven by the fierce tempest.&nbsp; If that
fine ship, which bore on her bosom the rich merchandise of
continental skill and <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>industry, be dashed against the
desperate assemblage of rocks, crags, and shoals surrounding the
bay&mdash;imagination with its utmost stretch could form but a
very imperfect idea of so direful and so appalling a
spectacle.&nbsp; As the villagers gazed upon the tumultuous
billows, they saw the ship, which had battled many a stormy
breeze, uplifted on the briny surge, then plunging headlong down
the repelling rock.&nbsp; In that terrible collision, a hole
nearly three feet square, was made in the bottom, through which
the sea rushed in with terrible force, on which she began to
sink.&nbsp; When this was discovered, the crew, in wild despair,
called to the men on the beach to come and help them.&nbsp; They,
however, moved not, but waited the issue with the most stolid
indifference.&nbsp; Amid that cry of despairing anguish the sea
rolled in with increased violence and fury, the waves dashing
over the fast-sinking ship, and carrying along with them the
unfortunate crew.&nbsp; Presently there was seen clinging to a
frail board a young man, comely in form and handsomely <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>dressed.&nbsp; Having fastened himself to this, the
wreckers heard him beseeching them, in most piteous cries to come
and help him.&nbsp; However, to that cry no attention was
paid.&nbsp; Seeing this, he, with a voice which moved even the
hard hearts of the wreckers, called out, &ldquo;Oh, my father, my
father! if you love your son, who has been a dutiful and a
faithful son to you&mdash;if there be in your bosom any affection
for him who has only lived to promote your welfare and interest;
who, in your declining years, has laboured and striven, and
thereby has succeeded in redeeming the manor of Dunraven from its
heavy incumbrance&mdash;send the men to save me from a watery
grave!&rdquo;&nbsp; That cry the lord of Dunraven heard.&nbsp; It
pierced his very soul.&nbsp; His countenance was marked with
anguish, blended with despair.&nbsp; All he could say was,
&ldquo;It is my own son Walter, and I have caused his
death!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then fell down in a fit.&nbsp; When the
wreckers heard their master&rsquo;s exclamation they, as one man,
took to the sea.&nbsp; Towards the drowning man they <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>pressed
forward with great energy, and at last succeeded in touching the
frail board.&nbsp; At that moment there was a terrible sea,
which, in receding, carried away the young lord of Dunraven and
the whole of the wreckers, except Mac the Devil, who succeeded in
gaining the shore.&nbsp; The Lord of Dunraven, when he recovered
from the swoon, learned all that had happened, even of his
son&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; From that night Mr. Vaughan was never
seen at Dunraven Castle.&nbsp; He went forth, bowed down with age
and with sin, a wandering ghost, seeking rest but finding
none.&nbsp; No one ever heard that he was sorry on account of the
crimes he had committed against heaven and earth.&nbsp; In a few
years afterwards news came to Wales that in an encounter with a
highwayman, in the North of England, the once great lord of
Dunraven was slain, and his body was thrown over the rocks into
the sea.&nbsp; In his pockets were found papers which led to his
identification.&nbsp; As his money had been taken by the robber,
he was buried at the expense of the parish in which <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>his body was
found.&nbsp; Such was the life and such the end of a man who
sought riches by robbery, and gold by the sacrifice of human
life.&nbsp; Indeed, he lived a miserable life, and died a
miserable death.</p>
<p>As regards the other persons of this history but little
remains to be told.&nbsp; Mac, on that night, disappeared from
the scene.&nbsp; But every nook and corner of the coast was
watched and carefully guarded night and day.&nbsp; The people of
the neighbourhood expressed their confidence that Mac was still
in the locality, in his old hiding-place.&nbsp; After watching
for a fortnight, during which there were no signs of his
appearance, they were almost persuaded to give up the
affair.&nbsp; However, they resolved still to continue guarding
the coast for another week.&nbsp; The day before that week
expired, one of the watchers saw in the sea, coming out from
between two rocks, a man diving.&nbsp; Evidently he had come from
some subterranean cavern, with an outlet under the water.&nbsp;
This man was Mac the Devil.&nbsp; He was there and then taken,
and lodged <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>in gaol.&nbsp; At the following assizes he was found
guilty of murder and was condemned to die.&nbsp; Before his death
he confessed all, and left behind him a record of his exploits,
and a detailed account of his connection with the lord of
Dunraven.&nbsp; Before that record was read, Mr. Vaughan had
breathed his last.</p>
<p>But what became of Captain John?&nbsp; It was his vessel that
went down, and it was young Vaughan&rsquo;s cargo with which she
was laden.&nbsp; On the morning subsequent to the wreck he was
found on the seashore in Dunraven Bay, with his body much
bruised, and his face covered with blood.&nbsp; He was, however,
still alive, and thanks to the careful nursing of his wife and
medical skill, he soon recovered, and gave up going to sea.&nbsp;
Ever afterwards he lived at home.&nbsp; He became an excellent
farmer, and saved money.&nbsp; He lived to a good old age, and
left behind a numerous family, who were as distinguished for
their virtue as they were for their industry.&nbsp; In this world
he moreover lived as <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>he wished to die, leaving behind him
a pattern of religiousness which his children, and their children
after them, followed.&nbsp; Thus, while the end of the good
captain was happy and peaceful, that of the lord of Dunraven was
full of anguish, while he met with a doom which it is terrible to
contemplate.</p>
<h2><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>PARSON
JONES,<br />
AND HIS CONQUESTS OVER THE ARCH-FIEND OF PANDEMONIUM.</h2>
<p>[The following strange stories of Cambrian life contain not an
<i>ideal</i> but a <i>real</i> picture of society in days of
yore.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, some of the names of the
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> are not given, but the family of
Jones being so large, <i>the man</i> will not be recognised by
the retention of the name he actually bore.&nbsp; Further, it is
believed that the whole of his relations are dead.&nbsp; He had
two nieces that survived him, who on his death were by no means
<i>young ladies</i>.&nbsp; They then quitted Wales, never more to
return.&nbsp; One more word only need be added, namely, that Mr.
Jones&rsquo;s fame as a preacher was universal, and the belief
that he had power <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>over Satan was firmly entertained by all, though he
himself repudiated the possession of such power.&nbsp; Mr. Jones
lived to nearly a hundred years of age, and died about thirty
years ago.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Hail! all hail! to thee, thou illustrious dead!&nbsp; Though
thy spirit has long since left the regions of earth, and has
passed into the <i>Gwlad well</i>, yet thy memory is fresh and
green, and thy deeds of charity, thy unassuming piety, thy
faithful preaching of the Cross, thy example of saintly
resignation, as well as thy holy sanctitude, still live in the
hearts and memories of those who were privileged to listen,
sabbath after sabbath, to the glorious truths which fell from thy
lips, and who, moreover, were permitted to gaze upon and witness
the holy ripening of thy nature for a bright and a glorious
immortality.&nbsp; Of thee might it be truly said, that thy
enemies were few, and thy friends and well-wishers legion.&nbsp;
The reason of this was obvious.&nbsp; While others laboured for
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>earthly
honour and a perishable renown, the aspiration and desire of thy
soul was to do the work of Him in whose armour thou wast clothed,
and to be recognised, and honoured, and acknowledged of thy
Father at the Judgment of the Great Day.&nbsp; Thy departure to
that better land was to thee a happy departure.&nbsp; On thy
spirit leaving its tabernacle of clay, it took its flight, amid
the songs of angelic choirs, to that world wherein the Lamb shall
ever lead it to perennial springs and fountains of blessedness,
and where every tear shall be wiped away by the Redeemer.&nbsp;
But though the change to thee was a welcome one, oh, how
<i>un</i>welcome was it to thy sorrowing children on earth, who
were left behind in the wilderness!&nbsp; Though many, many years
have passed away since the day of thy departure to join the
choirs above, during which I have mixed much with the busy
world,&mdash;have seen the upheaving of peoples, revolution
following revolution, and have witnessed parts of Europe deluged
with the blood of some of its best and most <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>patriotic
sons,&mdash;yet I well remember, as if it were but as yesterday,
the sorrowful tidings of thy death, when all joined in saying,
&ldquo;That a prince and a great man had that day fallen in
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, amid our pensive sorrow and
grief, which almost rent many a stout heart; all were yet cheered
and solaced with the thought, that though the dark cloud of the
future obscured our vision, preventing our beholding the face of
the dear departed, nevertheless he was reposing joyfully in the
eternal sunshine, and reclining on the bosom of his Lord.</p>
<p>Now, though Parson Jones was a good and holy man, yet young
and old, rich and poor, the youth in his teens as well as those
over whose heads seventy summers had passed, not only admitted,
but actually declared, that he was a strange mortal.&nbsp; His
life and character were to them an enigma.&nbsp; While the
outward&mdash;the rational man&mdash;was clear and plain, yet the
inner life&mdash;the hidden and mysterious workings of the
intellectual and spiritual man&mdash;was above their <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>comprehension
and beyond their ken.&nbsp; Though they owned that their beloved
pastor held communion with Heaven, yet many affirmed, and
positively believed, that he had constant intercourse with the
Evil One.&nbsp; Though they devoutly entertained the opinion that
he held uninterrupted converse with Him who was the desire of all
nations, yet they clung to the opinion that he had fellowship
with him who reigns over the abode of woe.&nbsp; While they
believed that their dear friend possessed that faith by which
mountains are removed, and by means of which the rolling and
angry billows are hushed into calm repose on the bosom of the
vast and mighty deep, nevertheless, the tale went from cottage to
cottage, and from hamlet to hamlet, and was told and retold, with
deep seriousness, in high and in low places, that Parson Jones
could raise and lay the devil.&nbsp; And if legions of
ministering angels hovered round his path, imparting to him
comfort, solace, and joy, it was almost universally believed that
he had consultations with the grim spirits of the nethermost <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>regions.&nbsp; Hence they concluded that he was not only
all-powerful with Heaven, but that Satan himself, with all his
servants and allies, would fly at his bidding.&nbsp; In
consequence of this belief, Parson Jones had, at his parsonage, a
constant succession of visitors.&nbsp; If the busy housewife was
unsuccessful in her churning, Parson Jones must be at once
consulted, as he only, in the vicinity, had power to break the
spell, and drive to their place those evil spirits which
interfered with the beneficial operations of mankind.&nbsp; If
the farmer found his cattle ailing, of course the good
parson&rsquo;s advice was at once sought, which in all case was
readily obtained, the belief being that he only in that
neighbourhood could counteract and overcome the evil influence of
the witches, who, by their malevolence and wicked arts, sought to
bring destruction and ruin upon him and his household.&nbsp;
Again, if a house in the locality were haunted, the sleepers
being awakened from their slumbers of the night by unearthly
cries, by groans and terrible noises, we need hardly say the <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>good vicar
was sent for; and after one of his visits, the simple-hearted
people of the troubled dwelling believed, and positively
affirmed, that he had put his imperial Satanic majesty in his
snuff-box!&nbsp; And from that night their home was never
disturbed by the presence of a spiritual visitor, and they
congratulated themselves on having permanently got rid of the
disturber of their peace and repose, feeling certain that the
possessor of the snuff-box would see to it that the lid would be
kept securely fastened.&nbsp; These acts of Parson Jones were not
done in a corner; hence the news of his victory over the Evil One
spread far and wide; but while a few gave no credence to the
tales that were told, yet the people&mdash;the masses, both rich
and poor, the wise and the unlearned&mdash;believed in the
stories which were told of the good vicar&rsquo;s doings.</p>
<p>As my father&rsquo;s residence was adjacent to the vicarage,
as he and the worthy parson were sworn friends, and as the latter
had a strong personal liking to me, as also a deep <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>interest in
my future welfare and prospects, I having on several occasions
acquainted him with my strong aversion to my father&rsquo;s
pursuits, and that I intended to seek my fortune in the wide,
wide world&mdash;these and other matters brought me into frequent
contact with our common friend, at whose house I was a constant
and ever welcome visitor.&nbsp; There was, however, another
reason why I was so often found at his hospitable dwelling,
which, in passing, I will just mention.&nbsp; From my earliest
school days I had imbibed a strong thirst for knowledge, while
the sciences of astronomy, algebra, Euclid, and trigonometry, had
for me peculiar, and I might add, fascinating charms.&nbsp; In
pursuing those studies, however, I often met with difficulties,
which, unaided, and without the assistance of a teacher, I failed
to overcome.&nbsp; The good parson being well informed of my
pursuits, and being anxious to render me all the assistance in
his power, arranged that I was to spend every Monday evening at
his residence, where, in his study, he would quietly explain the
problems and <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>calculations I had failed to solve.&nbsp; As a teacher
he was so successful that, after going quietly over my
calculations, and explaining where I had gone wrong, he
invariably managed to make the whole matter as clear to my
perception as that two and two make four.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones was deeply read in the science of astronomy, and on
his perceiving that I was weekly making considerable progress in
a science he so deeply loved,&mdash;a science, too, which he
regarded as more sublime than any other, inasmuch as it
proclaimed the power, the wisdom, and the greatness of Him who
binds the sweet influences of the Pleiades and loosens the bands
of Orion, who can bring forth Mazzaroth in his season and guides
Arcturus with his sons,&mdash;it was no wonder, considering the
identity of our common feeling and inclination, that I became a
nightly visitor at the parsonage.&nbsp; During those visits I
learned much respecting other branches of knowledge with which,
previously, I was but little acquainted.&nbsp; Thus, wide fields
of human knowledge appeared to open before me, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the
possession of which was the deep aspiration of my soul.</p>
<p>But I must own that my visits to the parsonage afforded me an
interest beyond that of scientific and literary pursuits.&nbsp;
Night after night there were other visitors at the good
man&rsquo;s house, who came there to tell tales about
apparitions, ghosts, the doings of the witches, and the various
forms in which his imperial majesty of Pandemonium had appeared
to them.&nbsp; To these marvellous stories I always listened with
deep interest, as from my youngest days I had been taught by my
nurse to believe in the existence of ghosts.&nbsp; The people of
the neighbourhood believed that the parson had power over the
evil spirits when they troubled men, hence the reason of his
assistance having been so frequently sought.&nbsp; Many a tale I
have heard in the vicar&rsquo;s little study; but for the present
I shall only record the following strange stories.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was a stormy night in the month of January, when I was with
Mr. Jones in his <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>study.&nbsp; After sitting there some time, over a
problem in the Sixth Book of Euclid, the door gently opened, and
in walked Mrs. Lloyd, the wife of a neighbouring farmer, who, at
the request of Mr. Jones, took a seat by the fire.&nbsp; When she
entered the room I observed that she was deeply agitated, the
cause of which we soon learnt.&nbsp; As soon as she had warmed
herself and dried her garments, my friend and benefactor, in the
kindest possible way, asked the reason of her having come out on
so stormy and so boisterous a night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kum to see yoo, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and to tell yoo the sad calamity which has happened at our
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Mr. Lloyd is not ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, parson; leastwise he was well in body when I
left whome, but sorely troubled in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, my good friend?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir! it&rsquo;s too dreadful.&nbsp; I kunna tell
yoo.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose I must, for I&rsquo;m kum here on
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;Unless you tell me the cause of your trouble,
ma&rsquo;am, I cannot give you advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, parson, Moll McGee, of Cwmdu, dunna
yoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; I know that person very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo know, dunna yoo, Mr. Jones, that she&rsquo;s a
witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is so reported, Mrs. Lloyd; but you must not
believe all you hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, yoo do know very well she&rsquo;s a real witch, so
dunna yoo deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no personal knowledge of the fact,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the good parson; &ldquo;I have always
found her a harmless and inoffensive woman, though some persons
say she has put her mark on certain families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she has, indeed; so dunna yoo think she
ought to be hanged and quartered, and her body and bones, and her
heart and liver, burned by the common hangman, for causing so
much trouble and loss to poor and innocent folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely she has not paid you a visit, has
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;She ha, though; and, what is worse, she has
spoiled a beautiful churning of milk, and killed our pony, which
Lloyd was offered thirty pounds for at last May fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear this of Mrs. McGee,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Jones; &ldquo;but, my dear madam, when and how did this
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my daughter Mary was churning on Wednesday
morning, who should kum up to the dairy door but Moll the
witch.&nbsp; She sez, sez she, &lsquo;Will you give me some
buttermilk, Mrs. Lloyd?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; sez I; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no
buttermilk to spare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But yoo must,&rsquo; sez she, &lsquo;give me
some.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have sed the word, Mrs. McGee, that I&rsquo;ve
none to spare; and if I had, you shudna have any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; sez she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; sez I; &lsquo;because yoo are a bad
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had better give me som,&rsquo; sez she agen;
&lsquo;for if you won&rsquo;t it &rsquo;ul be the worse for
yoo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What will yoo do, Mary?&rsquo; sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll mark yore cattle,&rsquo; sez she,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span><i>leave</i> the mark there too, for
your hard-heartedness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t
give yoo milk.&nbsp; Yoo&rsquo;ll witch my things, will
yoo?&nbsp; Do thy worst Moll,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;for I dunna
fear thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; sez she, &lsquo;may yur milk never
turn into butter, may yur cows cease to give yoo milk, and may
yoo find some of yur beasts in the black quarry before another
week&rsquo;s gone, and may the curse of Mary of the Black Dingle
ever follow yoo and yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old hag, when she finished her curse, turned upon
her heel, and in a moment afterwards my daughter and me saw her
going through the gate in the form of a large black monkey.&nbsp;
After she left, we continued to churn away with all our might and
main, but the butter wouldna come, and since that day the cows
have refused to give us any milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the pony, Mrs. Lloyd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had almost forgotten to tell yoo about
that.&nbsp; Well, last night, as Lloyd was coming whome from the
fields, he saw a black monkey on the back of the pony.&nbsp; The
brute was urging <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>the poor creature forward by sticking her devilish claws
in the pony&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; And will yoo believe it&mdash;God
ha&rsquo; mercy upon us! for we live in strange times,&mdash;the
monkey drove the pony straight for the quarry.&nbsp; Lloyd saw
her fall over the rock, and running up to the edge of the quarry,
saw the poor creature dashed to atoms at the bottom, and Moll
standing by grinning.&nbsp; But p&rsquo;raps yoo wunna believe
the truth of my story, but it is as true as I&rsquo;m a Christian
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jones with great
firmness, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that Mary McGee, or any
mortal, possesses the power which you evidently believe she does
possess.&nbsp; Heaven has not delegated to sinful mortal, nor
even to any of His creatures, power to inflict injury affecting
life or limb upon any of the creatures He has made, and by whose
power and goodness they are sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo are a learned man, and I&rsquo;m no scholard,
tho&rsquo; I kun read my Bible, thank God! and that book tells me
that evil spirits did enter into man and beast; and parson, yoo
cunna make <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>me believe that the arch-fiend has not entered into the
heart of that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, I beseech you, my friend, give too
much credence to idle tales and silly talk; and pray don&rsquo;t
believe that she is the real cause of, and the instrument by
which, this affliction has come upon you.&nbsp; If you were to
sift thoroughly the evidence respecting Mary&rsquo;s
malpractices, you would discover, in the end, that the whole is
based upon hearsay, and on the inventions of persons who might
have fancied it possible for such things to exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lloyd,
&ldquo;these tales are not idle invention; I wish they was.&nbsp;
But as true as God made Llandegley Rocks, and I s&rsquo;pose He
made them, my cows wanna give no milk, and the cream wunna turn
to butter, churn as much as we will; and it&rsquo;s a fact
&rsquo;bout the old hag and our pony, as Lloyd witnessed the
whole matter.&nbsp; I believe, and Lloyd believes, and my
daughter believes it too, that our calamities are the result of
the evil influences of this witch, who has been practising upon
our creatures her infernal and malignant <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>arts.&nbsp; I
have now told you my tale, parson, and I want your
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish me to do, Mrs. Lloyd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir! there is only one thing yoo can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, yoo ask?&nbsp; Ye know very well.&nbsp;
Why, break the spell, to be sure.&nbsp; Until that&rsquo;s done
we shall neither have butter nor milk, and then how shall we be
able to pay our rent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t see how I can assist
you.&nbsp; Oh, I do wish you would not place any faith in this
woman&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cunna help it, Mr. Jones.&nbsp; But I do believe
this, that yoo can master her, and yoo only.&nbsp; I know yoo
have power over these evil spirits and witches, but especially
over Moll McGee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lloyd, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
afeared of yoo.&nbsp; Indeed, she said she was afeared of yoo;
and no wonder, for we know very well that yoo can master her
master&mdash;the great fiend himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;Pray, Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; remarked the vicar,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t for a moment entertain the belief that such
power belongeth to man, nor that I, one of the most sinful of
God&rsquo;s creatures, have authority over the ruler of
darkness.&nbsp; However, as your cattle are afflicted, I will
step up in the morning, and examine them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful to yoo, Misther Jones, for your
kindness.&nbsp; I shall now go whome with a lighter heart than I
came, for I know you will break the witch&rsquo;s
spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought Mr. Jones would give her a lecture about her faith
in his power.&nbsp; However, for this she waited not; for on
securing his promise she rose from her chair, and took her
departure, wishing us both a hearty good-night.</p>
<p>In about a quarter of an hour after Mrs. Lloyd had left, who
should walk into the study but Mrs. McGee, who took possession of
Mrs. Lloyd&rsquo;s seat without any invitation from the
vicar.&nbsp; When she had made herself comfortable before the
blazing fire of wood on the hearth, Mr. Jones addressed
her:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you out so late to-night, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to speak with you on
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is rather late for business now.&nbsp; Why did
you not come earlier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Mrs. Lloyd had not visited you till
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what had her visit to do with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything; &rsquo;cause she come to tell you a tale
&rsquo;bout me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear, Molly, she has a very just cause of complaint,
against you especially, if reports be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck to her, and all she has, Mr. Jones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Withdraw that word this moment, Molly; or,&rdquo; his
piercing eye being fixed on the woman, which appeared to enter
her soul, &ldquo;I must use my power&mdash;that is, I must
request you to leave my house this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think she was a hard-hearted woman
not to give a poor body a dhrop of buttermilk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that, Molly; but if she be <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>hard-hearted,
there is no reason why any one should wish her ill.&nbsp; I must,
therefore, insist on your withdrawing your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do so, Mister Jones, it wonnot be for her, but for
your sake, who has always been kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have spoken like a sensible woman, Molly.&nbsp; I
have one more request to make, Mrs. McGee; that is, promise me
you won&rsquo;t go near Mrs. Lloyd again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear-a-me, you are a strange mon, parson.&nbsp; Between
you an&rsquo; me and the post, I&rsquo;ve no wish to go near the
likes of her, as she has no pity on a poor starving
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you have now promised me not to go near Mrs. Lloyd,
just go into the kitchen and get some supper, and make haste
home, for it is getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mrs. McGee left us, I also left to depart.&nbsp; On the
ensuing afternoon I was informed, that before daylight next
morning, Mr. Jones, before the family were up, had paid a visit
to Mrs. Lloyd&rsquo;s cow-house, and had given to each beast a
small ball made up of herbs.&nbsp; <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>When these were swallowed the cattle
appeared scarcely able to contain themselves for delight.&nbsp;
Mr. Jones saw by their appearance that his medicine (?) had
proved successful; so calling up the family, he informed them
that the spell was broken.&nbsp; The cows no longer refused to
give milk, and Mrs. Lloyd even declared that it was superior in
quality to what she previously had.&nbsp; Subsequently, she
experienced no difficulty in her churning operations.&nbsp; The
fame of Mr. Jones spread, in consequence, far and wide, and,
unfortunately for his own peace and comfort, applications to him
for assistance, when the witches had afflicted man or beast,
became incessant.</p>

100</span>PARSON JONES&rsquo;S TALE OF NAT THE SMITH AND THE
THREE WISHES.</h3>
<p>It was a dreary night in the month of December when there sat
in the chimney-corner of the Jolly Fiddler&mdash;which, as you
know, is the chief public-house in the little village of
Nantglyn&mdash;Nat the smith.&nbsp; Nat, as you are aware, is a
real good fellow, and a hard-working man, but, unfortunately, he
is terribly fond of his beer.&nbsp; I have been told that he has
spent a little fortune at the Jolly Fiddler, and I can well
believe it, for he pays nightly visits to the house, which he
never leaves until he has had two quarts of ale; and I fear that
latterly he has not confined himself to that quantity.&nbsp;
However, I am anticipating this part of my story, and must first
narrate, as succinctly as possible, the incidents of Nat&rsquo;s
life during the past seven years.&nbsp; Besides, I am anxious to
finish telling you the story to-night, though I am not sure I can
complete it, as there is a gap in the history of my friend Nat
which <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>has not yet been made up.&nbsp; With the above remarks
by way of introduction, we will now go back to the dreary night
of December already alluded to.</p>
<p>After Nat had sat for some time in the chimney-corner at the
Jolly Fiddler, he called out to the landlord,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another quart, Bill; and mind it&rsquo;s from the
barrel in the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Nat,&rdquo; replied the landlord; &ldquo;you
shall ha&rsquo; a quart of the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the sixpence, Bill,&rdquo; said Nat, when
the ale was placed before him on the table; &ldquo;and, upon my
soul, I&rsquo;ve not another copper left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about the money, Nat; I&rsquo;ll trust you
for as much as you like to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee knows, Will, I never allow scoring for beer.&nbsp;
Ready money or no ale, is my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a good motto it is, Nat.&nbsp; Oh, I wish all my
customers was like you; for if they was, I should have no fear of
being marched off to Lunnun (London) to be
whitewashed.&rdquo;&nbsp; (A <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>provincialism implying the passing
the Bankruptcy Court.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no danger of me going up there, Will,&rdquo;
rejoined Nat.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why, no one will trust
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunna thee say that, Nat; for thee knows very well that
I&rsquo;ll trust thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust or no trust, Will, here goes,&rdquo; and putting
the jug of foaming ale to his mouth he drank a good draught; and
then smacking his lips, said, &ldquo;Upon my word, this is the
real &lsquo;cwrw da.&rsquo;&nbsp; A quart of this is worth a
gallon of the last brewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it ought to be, Nat; for I put four bushels of best
malt to this barrel in the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake, Bill, about its strength; and
between us, as old friends, my only fear is that I shall not be
able to get my fair allowance of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! of that you need not be afraid, Nat; &rsquo;cause
why, I only give this beer to my constant and my very best
customers, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of which I am one, I s&rsquo;pose you was going to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;And if I had said so, Nat, I should ha&rsquo;
spoken the literal truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the above conversation a gentleman, unperceived by the
landlord and his best customer, entered the kitchen of the Jolly
Fiddler.&nbsp; He was clad in a suit of black, over which he wore
a long cloak of invisible green, the bottom of which trailed on
the ground.&nbsp; He had on his head a felt wideawake, which was
so inclined in front that his eyes were not perceptible, while
the rest of his face was shut from view by an immense quantity of
long, smooth, glossy hair, which descended over and below his
shoulders.&nbsp; He had entered the kitchen of the Jolly Fiddler
silently, and taking up a position between the door and
chimney-corner in which the smith was sitting, and at the
landlord&rsquo;s back, his presence was unperceived by
both.&nbsp; On that spot he had stood during the conversation
between Nat and Bill, to which he had listened with great
attention.&nbsp; When the landlord turned away from his friend
Nat, to attend to the duties of his house, he was astonished to
find the presence of the stranger, whose <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>strange
appearance struck him with awe, and his tongue clove to the roof
of his mouth.&nbsp; However he summoned up his courage, and
taking a slanting direction, he escaped through a side door into
the little back parlour of the inn.</p>
<p>Nat was not a spectator of this scene.&nbsp; When Will left
him, he took his quart of ale in his hand, and composing himself
in the chimney corner, he sat there, intently watching the
glowing wood-fire before him.&nbsp; There he sat, now and then
sipping his ale, as professed wine-drinkers sip their port,
remarking to himself, after each succeeding draught, &ldquo;This
is capital stuff! it warms the cockles of one&rsquo;s heart as it
goes down; but, poor me! when, oh when, shall I have sixpence in
my pocket to buy another quart?&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s a sad thing
to be poor in this rich land of plenty!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not
right for me and my class to starve for good ale, when our
wealthy neighbours have their cellars full, and plenty of gold to
buy more.&nbsp; If I was rich, the poor man should never want for
a pint or a jug of the real &lsquo;cwrw da.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah, me!
I sha&rsquo; never be rich.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m born to be <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>poor, and
to labour as them sparks fly up the chimney.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
sad, very sad, and heart-breaking, to have an empty pocket when
one&rsquo;s soul is thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat sat thus musing and talking to himself for nearly half an
hour.&nbsp; At last he finished his ale, and then, taking his
stick in his hand, rose to go home.&nbsp; There was no one in the
kitchen now.&nbsp; Nat thought this very strange, as Bill was
generally about; but he fancied, as he rose to depart, that he
saw the shadow of a human form on the wall.&nbsp; Of this he took
no particular notice at the time; but, on listening to
Will&rsquo;s story the following day, Nat felt that the supposed
shadow was a terrible reality.</p>
<p>Nat left the inn with a heavy heart.&nbsp; It is true he had
had his quart of good ale, but he thought that, as work was
slack, he would have considerable difficulty &ldquo;in raising
the wind&rdquo; for several days, and this affliction had a
depressing influence on his spirits.&nbsp; At last he reached the
little wicket gate leading from the highway to his cottage; but
on his opening <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>it, he was awe-struck on seeing coming from his house
along the garden-path, a gentleman clad in deep mourning.&nbsp;
As there was something in the appearance of the gentleman Nat did
not like, he attempted to avoid him by leaving the path free; but
when Nat turned out of the path the figure turned too, and came
up, meeting the smith face to face, and addressed him
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are rather late to-night, Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I be late, sir,&rdquo; retorted Nat, &ldquo;I do not
see it&rsquo;s any business of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, friend, I meant no harm,
for my object in meeting you here is to afford you help and
counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need, sir, no man&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; replied Nat;
&ldquo;and when I require advice I&rsquo;ll seek it at the house
of a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, friend Vulcan, I can give you the help which no
<i>man</i> can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it then, sir, to those who seek; as for me I
desire it not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are poor, friend, and penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is poverty, sir, a crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;Oh no, friend, poverty is not a crime; but you
must own, Mr. Smith, that an empty pocket is very inconvenient
for a thirsty soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know, sir, that my pocket&rsquo;s
empty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My knowledge of the fact, friend, is derived from your
own confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I never confessed to you, &rsquo;cause why, I
never saw you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak truly on that point, friend Vulcan;
nevertheless, I must tell you I heard your confession to-night at
the Jolly Fiddler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see you there, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not.&nbsp; I was there, notwithstanding; and I
heard you declaring to Will, the landlord, that you then parted
with the last sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve spent all, sir, I can work and earn
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, you can work: but I know you do not like work;
and if you will comply with my wishes, you shall have all you
require without working another hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your wish, sir, and the nature of your
service?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;I will tell you, Mr. Vulcan, in a few
words.&nbsp; But, first, let me say that I take a deep interest
in you, and am supremely anxious to promote your welfare.&nbsp;
Now, if you will consent to become my son, at the expiration of
seven years from this hour, I will grant you any three things you
might desire, whatever they may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do what, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grant you any three things&mdash;riches,
wealth, possessions, or anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for these benefits, what do you require from
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I require, Mr. Nat, is that, at the expiration of
seven years, you will acknowledge me as your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&mdash;that is, I don&rsquo;t know what to
say to your proposal.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m a free man, and
I&rsquo;d rather be my own master than be the slave of
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, friend, when you have plenty of money you will be
your own master, and besides, with a full pocket you can drink as
much as you like of Will&rsquo;s best beer.&nbsp; I shall
guarantee in the bond your pockets shall be always
full.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;To-morrow night, if you will meet me, I will
give you an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, friend, it will be too late.&nbsp; Your
decision must be now or never.&nbsp; If you desire a merry and a
jolly life, having a full pocket and plenty of good ale, sign
this bond, which read for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nat took the document from the hand of the stranger, which he
carefully read twice over.&nbsp; When completing its second
perusal, he remarked that it appeared all right, though not
wholly satisfactory as it contained no sentence <i>securing the
blessings</i> for which he had to wish <i>during the seven
years</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be satisfactory to you then, friend, if words
to that effect are added?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Nat.</p>
<p>The stranger then wrote upon the bond the words Nat desired
should be added, and presenting it to the smith, he at once
signed the document, when, on its being done, the stranger
vanished out of his sight, leaving Nat there in darkness and
alone.&nbsp; However, he ultimately <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>found the door of his cottage, and,
on entering, went at once to bed.</p>
<p>It was noon on the succeeding morning before Nat awoke.&nbsp;
He had, like all beer and spirit drinkers, slept himself
sober.&nbsp; When he was aroused from his slumbers, he began to
think over the previous night&rsquo;s scene, and, step by step,
he was at last able to trace the whole of his doings from the
time he left home until his return, and then he fully realized
his present position.&nbsp; The sad fact that he had sold himself
body and soul to the arch-fiend was now a terrible reality.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have been a fool, and no mistake,&rdquo; said he to
himself; &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be
helped.&nbsp; Here is the bond, the conditions of which I&rsquo;m
bound to carry out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then got up, and dressed
himself, and going downstairs, he found his dinner, which
consisted of potatoes and milk, on the table.&nbsp; After
partaking of a portion of the dinner his too-indulgent wife had
prepared for him, addressing his faithful Betsy he unconsciously
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, old girl, we had fried bacon with the
potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>No
sooner had the words escaped his lips than there appeared before
him on the little round table a plateful of savoury bacon, on
which he was so enraged with his own want of prudence, that he
wished it and its contents under the grate, when it was removed
thither by some invisible hand.&nbsp; Nat, on witnessing this,
foamed with passion, and danced and cursed and swore like one
possessed with the evil one.&nbsp; He carried on his ravings for
some time to the astonishment of his wife, as she could not
divine the cause of his strange conduct; and amid one of his fits
of rage he exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, that I had a jug of Will&rsquo;s
best beer, for my mouth and my tongue are on fire!&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a moment the foaming ale was placed on the table, and Nat
swallowed it at a single draught.&nbsp; When he placed the empty
jug on the table, he said, addressing his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Betsy! what a fool I&rsquo;ve been.&nbsp; I was
promised riches, possessions, and honours, if I&rsquo;d do a
particular thing, but my only reward is a jug of ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day Nat was an altered man.&nbsp; He ceased his
visits to the Jolly Fiddler.&nbsp; <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Occasionally he was to be found in
his shop, but more frequently he might be seen walking up and
down the mountain-side alone, with an air of pensive sadness on
his brow.&nbsp; As years rolled on he became more dejected and
depressed in spirits, the cause of which was known to no
mortal.&nbsp; He did not even tell his wife the terrible secret
of his unhappiness.&nbsp; Years and years passed on with this
heavy load on his heart.&nbsp; At last it came to the very day
but one when he had to fulfil the condition of the bond.&nbsp;
Why or wherefore I do not know, but the thought struck him about
me, and thinking, perhaps, that I could afford him some little
aid, he started off yesterday morning, and he spent several hours
with me here last night.&nbsp; He told me the whole of his tale,
and when he had completed its recital, I said to him very kindly,
but firmly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done, my friend, a very wicked
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O sir, I know I have; but my heart is so depressed,
pray do not, therefore, upbraid me now, but try and afford me
some assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t see my way to help you,
especially as your enemy is so subtle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear pastor, I think you can break the net in
which he has caught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one way of defeating him, Nat; that way
is, by prayer and supplication for Divine help and guidance when
the hour of your doom comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O sir, I have poured out my whole soul to my Redeemer,
but I&rsquo;ve received no answer to my prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relief, Nat, may yet come.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t cease
in your petitions to the throne of mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly afraid, sir, that my sins are so
black, there is no hope for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While there is life, friend, there is hope; and even
yet, at the eleventh hour, a way of escape may be opened to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised if there be, sir; but this bond is
too explicit in terms, and he who holds the counterpart is too
exacting, for me to hope for an escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the bond, then, Nat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir! here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&ldquo;Have you received the benefits of its
conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only benefit I received was one jug of beer.&nbsp;
As for the bacon, that was devoured by the flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a line, which appears as an afterthought,
added to the bond, namely, guaranteeing the security of the
blessings wished for during a period of seven years.&nbsp; Do you
now say, Nat, that you have not participated in the benefits of
the wishes during the seven years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, sir, in the most solemn manner, that the
only benefit I had was the jug of ale already referred
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Nat, I think I can help you out of your
difficulty, and I will pray Heaven to succour and assist you in
the terrible encounter awaiting you.&nbsp; But to insure success
you must observe to the letter my directions.&nbsp; Will you
promise me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most solemnly I promise to obey you to the
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must fulfil your engagement with the enemy, and if
he insists on your carrying out <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>the condition of the bond, then tell
him to his face that you will not do so, unless he will first
carry out <i>his</i> conditions about the seven years.&nbsp; If
he refuses, then demand another wish, and as you have received no
benefit from the previous ones, he will, I think, concede the
point.&nbsp; If so, then let your wish be that something terrible
might happen to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, said the parson to me, I can proceed no further with my
tale.&nbsp; Every moment I am anxiously waiting news, or the
return of Nat.&nbsp; If he comes you shall hear the rest of the
story from his own lips,&mdash;whereupon Nat entered, and
throwing up his hat to the top of the room, cried out, &ldquo;He
is conquered! he is conquered!&nbsp; Hurrah for Parson
Jones!&nbsp; Hurrah for the good Vicar of Llan! before whom both
witches and devils flee.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last Nat became calm and
composed, when he proceeded to complete the tale, which I tell in
his own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met the old chap at the appointed time and place,
when he produced the bond, and asked me if I was ready to
accompany him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, said I, &lsquo;Not yet, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you have not
fulfilled the conditions of the bond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In what have I failed?&rsquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In this,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I was, by the
bond, to enjoy the blessings for seven years, and I&rsquo;ve had
only one jug of beer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But that was your fault,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether it be my fault or not,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I will not come with you unless you fulfil your
conditions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will not wait for you another seven
years,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but I will permit your having one
more wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do what?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will grant you the privilege of one more
wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You really will?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; but, mind, my only reason for granting
it,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is that you appear to feel that I have
taken an advantage of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I wish you on
the back of your fiery dragon; and, then, that the dragon carry
you straight to Llynfan, and that you both <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>be drowned
in that lake, and never appear to disturb me more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had finished my wish there was a terrible clap
of thunder, which shook the earth beneath me to its very
foundation, and it was followed by a vivid flash of lightning
which lit up the whole mountain; and, looking across the valley,
I then saw both the dragon and its rider disappear in that
fathomless llyn.&nbsp; When I saw this I dropped down upon the
cold ground, and then poured forth my heart&rsquo;s thanksgivings
to Him who had wrought me, through you, my dear pastor, so great,
so glorious a victory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the enchanting vale below Pont Aberglaslyn there stood,
many many years ago, a small villa, which at the time of which we

was covered over with ivy.&nbsp; Surrounding this beautiful rural
retreat were gardens and pleasure grounds, which were designed
and laid out with great artistic taste and skill in the
arrangement of walks, shrubs, rose-trees, flowers, and
evergreens.</p>
<p>At the time our story commences, the villa was occupied by a
gentleman whose family had seen better days; but, through the
prodigality of ancestors and the vast sums they had squandered in
horse-racing, cock-fighting, and gambling, the rent-roll of their
estate which approached &pound;12,000 a year, now scarcely
reached a hundredth part of that sum after the interest had been
paid.&nbsp; Indeed, when the then owner came into possession of
his patrimony on the death of his father, his net income barely
reached &pound;6 a week.&nbsp; On discovering his pecuniary
position, he felt he could no longer afford to occupy the family
mansion, and like a wise man he prudently resolved to leave it,
and remove to the villa we have already described.&nbsp; During
the residence of the family at the old Hall, Mrs. Wynn&mdash;that
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>being
the name of the family&mdash;left her household affairs to her
servants, who unfortunately paid but little regard to domestic
economy.&nbsp; However, when she took up her residence in her new
abode she wisely undertook the chief management of her household;
while Mr. Wynn devoted his time to the cultivation of the garden
and superintending the education of his son and daughter.&nbsp;
Both proved apt learners; what they learned they
remembered.&nbsp; Whatever book they read, they retained its
contents in their singularly retentive memories.&nbsp; In
pursuing their studies, fortunately they had this great advantage
in their favour,&mdash;namely, that their parent was a ripe
scholar and an eminent man of letters, while as a teacher he
possessed abilities of the highest order.&nbsp; Having such an
instructor, no wonder his beloved pupils made such rapid
progress.&nbsp; After teaching them thoroughly the rudiments, Mr.
Wynn led on his children step by step to higher grounds; but in
all his lessons he sought to instil into their young minds a
strong and passionate desire, a <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>longing thirst, for knowledge, the
possession of which had afforded him some of the happiest and the
most pleasurable hours of his life.&nbsp; Thus occupied, year
after year came and rolled by, and each revolving year brought
increased happiness to the little family of the villa.&nbsp;
Truly did they live in each other&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>When their son Cadwgan had attained his fifteenth year, his
sister Gwenfan being two years younger, their father was on one
Saturday called away to the ancient town of Carnarvon, in order
to transact some special business with the family
solicitor.&nbsp; When he left home in the morning he promised to
return the same evening, but though his wife and children waited
his return until midnight, he came not.&nbsp; At last, sick and
weary at heart, they retired to rest; but during the remainder of
the night they were not roused by his well-known knock at the
hall-door.&nbsp; Early on the ensuing Sabbath morning, a special
messenger arrived at the villa from Carnarvon, with the sorrowful
intelligence that Squire <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Wynn had been seized with a virulent
attack of small-pox, a disease which was then fearfully raging in
the town and neighbourhood, and the messenger urged Mrs. Wynn to
hasten to the bedside of her husband, if she desired to see him
alive.&nbsp; With an aching heart she kissed and bade adieu to
her son and daughter, and hastened to the bedside of the almost
lifeless form of him who had ever been the light of her eyes and
the joy of her heart.&nbsp; She saw at the first glance that the
hour of his departure had come.&nbsp; She threw herself on the
bed by his side, when he tenderly embraced her, saying,
&ldquo;Heaven bless you, my angel!&rdquo; and then pointing his
finger upwards, &ldquo;Meet me there, and bring our dear ones
with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then heaved a deep sigh, and his spirit
took its flight to the <i>gwlad well</i> (the better land).&nbsp;
Before that day&rsquo;s sun had descended into the western sea,
Mrs. Wynn was attacked with the same fatal malady; and before the
dawn of the following morning, her gentle and loving spirit had
fled its earthly tabernacle for the <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>land of eternal and ethereal
joy.&nbsp; Thus were their children bereft of both father and
mother in a single day, and before they were made acquainted with
the terrible loss they had sustained, the forms they loved so
well had been placed in the same tomb.</p>
<p>To the children the Monday and Tuesday following were days of
anxious thought.&nbsp; No tidings had reached them of the sad
event that had happened.&nbsp; It was late on Tuesday evening
that a kind friend arrived from the solicitor bringing the sad
intelligence of their parents&rsquo; decease.&nbsp; They were
overwhelmed with sorrow on account of their loss.&nbsp; Days and
days elapsed before they could realize their position.&nbsp; At
last they were painfully impressed with the fact that they were
alone in the world.&nbsp; No loving word now, in welcome and
joyous voice, greeted them on entering their home.&nbsp; The
arm-chair in which their father sat evening after evening, when
he was used to tell them tales of years that had gone, and the
couch on which their mother reclined before retiring to her
bedroom, were <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>both unoccupied.&nbsp; The sudden death of both, taken
in connection with the responsibilities of the present and their
anxieties pertaining to the future, nearly broke their young and
tender hearts.&nbsp; But they sorrowed not as those who had no
hope.&nbsp; From childhood they had been taught to love the dear
Name which is above every name, and confident of His favour, and
with full reliance on the promise that He would be a father to
the fatherless, their gentle spirits became calm and
peaceful.&nbsp; Moreover, they looked forward to a bright
immortality, when they would join those whom their souls
loved.&nbsp; Thus, as day after day came and departed, they
became more resigned to their lot.&nbsp; Their griefs were
assuaged by night voices from the world above.&nbsp; Often, in
the evening twilight, they heard whispers from the spirits of the
dear departed ones.&nbsp; And the spirits said, after a few more
years of toil, of labour, of sorrow, of anxiety and trouble, you
will come up hither, and then you shall mingle your voices with
ours, in praising Him, who has <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>washed us from our sins in His own
blood.&nbsp; That day there will be a joyous reunion in this
spirit world where parting is no more.</p>

<i>AN INHERITANCE LOST</i>, <i>BUT A FRIEND FOUND</i>.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Is not this a lovely April morning?&rdquo; remarked
Cadwgan to his sister, as they walked hand-in-hand across the
lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed, a most lovely morning, brother.&nbsp;
And is not the scene around most enchanting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Gwenfan, have always been a great admirer of the
spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, dear Cadwgan, have been its enthusiastic
admirer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have loved it, my dear sister, because it is the
season of the year when nature puts on its most joyous
apparel.&nbsp; The trees and flowers, the hedgerows and forests,
the cornfields and meads, all all are decked in their green
robes.&nbsp; When spring comes, after the deathlike appearance of
winter with its cold and chilling air, nature springs into new
life; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>the trees send forth their green leaves, the rose its
blossom, the meadows put on their usual dress, and Nature appears
to say to all, Come, come, and behold my triumphant resurrection
from the death of winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does not the animal creation, my brother,
participate in the glories of spring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, oh, do listen to the joyous melody of the
skylark, and see, see how he mounts higher and higher, and sings
as he ascends!&nbsp; From yon thorny bush don&rsquo;t you hear
the blackbird&rsquo;s sweet notes? while the mellow bullfinch
answers those notes from yonder sylvan grove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is love, my dearest brother, that creates this
music; all this waste of melody is the heavenly voice of sweetest
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, my dear sister, that this melody is
wasted.&nbsp; Music is never wasted when there are people
listening to its soothing and joyous strains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But people, Cadwgan, do not always give ear to the
charming voices of these winged songsters.&nbsp; And are there
not hundreds, and <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>perhaps thousands, who fail to appreciate, who are
never moved by, their enchanting notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there are persons, my wise sister, who listen
unmoved to the melody of birds, I would be the last to deny; but
is there not an equally large number of persons who see no beauty
in verdant glades, in the bubbling crystal fountain, in the
rippling streamlet, and in the flowers as they open their petals
to draw in the morning dewdrop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you have referred to flowers, come, dear Cadwgan,
and look at my smiling blushing roses.&nbsp; Oh, they look so
lovely!&nbsp; Exquisitely beautiful are they, and their perfume
fills the morning air with the most delicious
fragrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, my dear Gwenfan, most beautiful; but pray
tell me the secret of your success in training them to so great a
perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can explain in a few words.&nbsp; I have nursed
them well.&nbsp; I have paid them as much attention as I have
paid to my birds, and I <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>love them almost as
much,&mdash;don&rsquo;t I, pretty, smiling, blushing
roses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be hard for you to part with this lovely
dwelling, won&rsquo;t it, Gwenfan; especially as it is endeared
to us by so many happy and hallowed associations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shan&rsquo;t leave here, brother; shall
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we shall be obliged to do so,
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry to hear you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry too, to break the news to you.&nbsp; The
thought of leaving our dear home almost breaks my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped, Cadwgan, never to say adieu to the abode
of our beloved parents, though the void created by our sad
bereavement can never be filled up.&nbsp; But, if we must leave,
whither shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, my darling sister, I know not where we
shall have to pitch our tent; but our heavenly Father, in His
good providence, will, if we trust Him, provide for us a
shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;I do love and trust Him, my dear brother; but,
oh, at this moment, the future appears to me dark and
beamless.&nbsp; I fail to see even a fringe of the cloud with a
silver lining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we look to the light, our future may still be
bright and joyous; as will be the appearance of yonder vale when
the dark cloud you see up there passes away.&nbsp; In a few
minutes this sylvan dell will be lighted up by the golden beams
of the morning sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, brother, look!&nbsp; The cloud is rapidly moving
on its journey.&nbsp; The rays of the king of day will soon fall
upon and penetrate both woodland and brake, warming and cheering
the dwellers in mossy beds and grassy mounds, imparting hope and
joy to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So may it be with us, dear Gwenfan.&nbsp; When we least
expect aid from on high, that aid comes, and at once the darkness
and gloom are chased away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here his sister called her brother&rsquo;s attention to a
lady driving a pony carriage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;the lady is coming to <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the villa.&nbsp; See! see! her
servant has opened the entrance gate at the bottom of the
lawn.&nbsp; Oh, who can she be?&nbsp; Do you expect any one to
visit us, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect no one, but hope that she may be a messenger
of good, not of evil; a harbinger of comfort, and not the bearer
of bad tidings and thus increase our affliction and sorrow.&nbsp;
Our cup of grief is already full and overflowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the carriage approached nearer to the villa, the children
saw that its occupant was clad in deep mourning, and that she
resembled some one whom they well knew, but whom they could not
at the moment recollect.&nbsp; Presently, the carriage was driven
up to the door, and the lady inquired of the orphans if the house
was called Bryn Villa, and if they were the children of Mr. and
Mrs. Wynn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, madam, their son,&rdquo; replied Cadwgan,
&ldquo;and this is my sister Gwenfan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I presume to ask the name of the lady who takes
care of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;We have no one taking care of us, madam,&rdquo;
replied Gwenfan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I look after my brother, and he
looks after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no one with you,&mdash;no grown up person
in charge of the house, and in charge of its
management?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have only a maid-servant in the house,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered the brother; &ldquo;and she has been
with us since we were little ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are then, my dears, left alone in the world.&nbsp;
Unless I have been misinformed, you have lost both
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both are dead, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered Gwenfan,
weeping; &ldquo;and neither my brother nor I am aware of having a
single relative living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had not your papa a sister?&rdquo; inquired the
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never heard dear papa speak of a sister, or any
relative,&rdquo; answered Cadwgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, sir, that is certainly very strange; because I
happen to know of his having a sister, whom he loved very
dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of her, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the youth,
&ldquo;papa never spoke.&nbsp; I remember hearing him say, <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>he had no
one left in the world to care for, except dear mamma and
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present we will say no more on the
subject.&nbsp; But having driven many a long mile, my dears,
since the morning, and still having a long journey before me, I
must claim your hospitality for food for my servant and
pony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are heartily welcome, ma&rsquo;am, to partake of
the best our house can afford,&rdquo; replied the children.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your servant will perhaps drive the pony into the yard,
and he will find there our man servant who will attend to his
wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady then descended from her phaeton, and was conducted by
the children into the house.&nbsp; During the time refreshments
were being prepared she made a minute inspection of the
parlour.&nbsp; When she had thoroughly surveyed it, and was about
to take a rest on the sofa, she saw what appeared to be a
picture, but the likeness was shut from view by a curtain of
green baize which hung over and covered both the picture and
frame.&nbsp; The <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>lady&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused, but just then she
heard the footsteps of the servant and the children in the
passage; but before they entered the room, she had succeeded in
drawing aside the baize, and had a glimpse of the likeness
beneath.&nbsp; When the children entered they perceived that the
lady appeared slightly agitated, though, necessarily, they were
wholly ignorant of its cause.</p>
<p>During the time she was engaged in partaking of the
refreshments which had been provided her, she talked and chatted
away on all manner of topics, but studiously avoided making any
allusion to herself.&nbsp; She asked the children many questions
about people in the neighbourhood, particularly about Mrs. Jones,
of the Glen; her sons and daughters, if they were all married,
and did they reside in the locality.&nbsp; She specially asked if
young Squire Jones were still a bachelor.</p>
<p>The children gave their visitor an account of the several
families she inquired for, and informed her that Mr. Jones was
still single, that he resided at the Glen, and had <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>succeeded
to his uncle&rsquo;s property, which brought in some
&pound;12,000 a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never heard, my dears, your papa mentioning
relatives either living or dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we don&rsquo;t recollect our papa making any
allusion to relatives, except,&rdquo; said Cadwgan, &ldquo;on one
occasion, when he said to mamma, &lsquo;I am afraid she is dead;
for were she alive she would certainly write to
us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, my dears, to whom he referred, and think I can
satisfy you that she is not dead, but still lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any information, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the youth,
&ldquo;with which you can furnish us will place us under deep
obligations to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you, my dears, ever seen the picture under the
green baize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know whose likeness it
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the brother and
sister, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, my dears,&rdquo;&mdash;removing the <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>covering,&mdash;&ldquo;tell me if you have ever seen
any one like that portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the children hesitated; and after looking first
at the portrait and then at the lady, said, &ldquo;The picture,
ma&rsquo;am, is very like you; or you resemble the
portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, my loves.&nbsp; Your dear papa was
my brother, and you, my dears, are my nephew and niece.&nbsp;
Come to my arms, and be assured that, as far as I can, I will
make up for the loss you have sustained.&nbsp; I will love you
deeply, fondly, ardently; and for my brother&rsquo;s sake, and
that of your kind, gentle, and loving mother, who was as dear to
me as my dear sister Gwenfan, who was the light and joy of our
homes, and for your own sakes, I will be your guide, your friend,
your counsellor and stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment the children were locked in the tender and loving
embrace of their aunt.&nbsp; They all wept, though their sorrows
were mixed with joy.&nbsp; To some extent the discovery thus made
relieved the sadness and gloom of the hour.&nbsp; In the hour of
gloom, when aid was <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>least expected, a comforter had been
found.&nbsp; But upon this scene we must not dwell.&nbsp; Their
aunt was a woman of action, and rest with her was impossible
until she had thoroughly mastered the children&rsquo;s
affairs.&nbsp; Hence, as soon as she and her pony had had
refreshment and an hour&rsquo;s rest, she, with her niece and
nephew, started off for Carnarvon to see the family solicitor,
and from that gentleman learnt that the old family estate of the
Wynns was mortgaged to its full value, and that the mortgagee had
now given notice to foreclose unless the sum borrowed was repaid
within a month.&nbsp; &ldquo;To do this,&rdquo; said the
solicitor, &ldquo;is, I fear, impossible, because the amount
borrowed&mdash;&pound;80,000&mdash;is so large that in these
times there are but few capitalists who have it at their
command.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then gave it as his deliberate opinion
that the best thing was for the mortgagee to sell, and if he
realized a sum beyond the encumbrance, it might be invested for
the joint use of the children.</p>
<p>This advice was acted upon by the aunt and orphans.&nbsp; A
few weeks after this <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>conversation, Wynn Castle and its
domain and estate were sold by auction, the fortunate purchaser
being a London merchant of great wealth, who during the first
three years of its possession expended on improvements
&pound;20,000.</p>
<p>When the affairs of Wynn Castle were all arranged, Cadwgan
resolved to seek his fortune in the wide wide world.&nbsp; His
aunt and sister did their best to dissuade him from leaving home,
but he turned a deaf ear to their arguments and entreaties.&nbsp;
At last they reluctantly acquiesced, and it was finally arranged
that his aunt and sister were to remain at the Villa (this house
and grounds forming no part of the Wynn Castle estate), the
former promising to supply as far as she was able the void which
death had created.</p>
<h3><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<i>THE WIDE WORLD</i>.</h3>
<p>It was a beautiful summer morning when Cadwgan departed from
the home of his love, the place endeared to him by so many happy
associations.&nbsp; The parting scene between him and his sister
was most painful.&nbsp; From childhood they had not been separate
from each other a single day.&nbsp; Gwenfan&rsquo;s love for her
brother was deep, ardent, and tender.&nbsp; Every want of his she
anticipated, while she paid the minutest attention to his
feelings, even in small and trivial matters.&nbsp; To part with
her only brother was indeed a sore trial; but she now felt she
could no longer resist his wishes, though the thought almost
broke her heart.&nbsp; Then Cadwgan&rsquo;s grief was equally
intense.&nbsp; He however felt that duty called him away; and
somehow there came into his soul a conviction that a day might
come when fortune would smile upon him, and on that day his
sister would bless him for having <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>forsaken the joys of home with its
smiles and sunshine, in obedience to what he regarded as a solemn
duty.&nbsp; At last he tore himself away from his sister&rsquo;s
and aunt&rsquo;s tender and affectionate caresses, leaving the
home of his childhood; and before the sun was up, grand old
Snowdon, with its circumjacent hills and mountain-tops, had
disappeared from his view.&nbsp; However, he lingered not on his
journey, but when the last old friend of his youth had
disappeared he put on new speed, resolving to arrive at the
metropolis of England and the world before the end of the
following week.</p>
<p>We shall not attempt to describe the journey and the incidents
which occurred by the way.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that in due
course he reached the great city, and during the first few days
after his arrival he wandered from street to street, traversing
its parks, alleys, and great thoroughfares; and during those
days&rsquo; wanderings he saw much of the busy scenes of city
life, especially those places where merchant princes most do
congregate.</p>
<p>After being in London about a week, faint, <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>weary and
worn, hungry and footsore, he sat down one evening in one of the
recesses of London Bridge, and wept.&nbsp; Though thousands
passed by not a soul took any notice of the sorrowing and weeping
boy.&nbsp; As the shades of night began to fall faster and faster
on the scene, the bridge became less crowded, and as the evening
advanced, became almost deserted.&nbsp; The poor youth now
thought seriously on his lonely and forlorn condition.&nbsp; To
procure a bed was almost impossible, as he knew not where to go;
and even if he did know, he could ill afford to spare two
shillings&mdash;the sum his landlord had charged him the previous
evening&mdash;because his little purse was nearly empty.&nbsp;
When the few shillings which remained were gone, he saw no
prospect before him but hunger and starvation, which he now
considered would be his inevitable fate.&nbsp; He now repented of
his somewhat rash act of leaving home before consulting with some
one as to the best course he should pursue.&nbsp; But his
repentance was too late.&nbsp; He placed himself in the hand of
his heavenly Father, and prayed to Him for help and <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>guidance.&nbsp; That prayer brought peace to his
troubled spirit.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful and balmy summer night, and he asked
himself the question, why could he not make himself quite
comfortable there for a single night?&nbsp; Having resolved to
sleep there for one night at least, he at once commenced to
arrange his pillow, which consisted of his carpet bag.&nbsp;
Having placed the bag on the ledge between the parapet and the
footpath, he lay down to sleep.&nbsp; Just as he was about to
close his eyes a gentleman came up, and stepping on the ledge
close to the youth&rsquo;s bag, looked over the parapet on the
ebbing tide below.&nbsp; Having remained in that position a few
minutes, he turned round for the purpose of descending to the
regular path in order to continue his journey, but in his descent
he saw the youth apparently asleep.&nbsp; He gazed on his
countenance for a few moments, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there, my child, this time of
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; replied Cadwgan, &ldquo;that my
sleeping here for a night will not be wrong.&nbsp; <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>I&rsquo;m
not in the way of any one, sir, and I won&rsquo;t do any
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no other place to go to, my child?&nbsp;
You can procure a bed somewhere, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might possibly do so, sir, but I can&rsquo;t well
spare the money to pay for a night&rsquo;s lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no friends or relations in town, my boy,
to whom you could apply for assistance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no friends in London, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you have relations in the country who are in
a position to aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a sister, sir, but she is nearly three
hundred miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Wales, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Wales your home&mdash;I mean your native
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;North or South Wales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in North Wales does your sister live?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>&ldquo;She lives at Bryn Villa, near Pont
Aberglaslyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, your name, my child, is not Wynn, is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my name, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are the son of Squire Wynn, of Wynn
Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wynn was my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is that dear good man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father and mother, sir, are both dead.&nbsp; I have
no one left to care for me but my sister, except my
aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly sorry to hear tidings so sad.&nbsp; What is
your aunt&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is Gwenfan Wynn, which is the name of my
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you not in error in calling her Wynn?&nbsp; I
heard she got married some years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt was never married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You greatly surprise me.&nbsp; I was given to
understand she married a Scotch gentleman, many, many years
ago.&rdquo;</p>

148</span>&ldquo;She did leave home with the intention of being
married to a Mr. McDonel, but finding, fortunately before it was
too late, that the representations he made of himself about his
property, estate, and high connections, were all false, she broke
off the match, and not wishing to return home then, when she
would probably be subjected to perhaps unkind observations, took
a situation in a nobleman&rsquo;s family then about to visit
Italy, with whom she has lived until within the last few
weeks.&nbsp; The family only recently returned to England, and on
the evening after their arrival, my aunt saw in the <i>Times</i>
the announcement of my parents&rsquo; death.&nbsp; She
immediately left London, and came to us in Wales.&nbsp; She is
now with my dear sister acting as her guardian and
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, my child, for your information.&nbsp; You
must now accompany me to my residence.&nbsp; You shall not want
for a home and a friend as long as Owen Jones lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I do not wish, nor can I consent, to live on
charity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve come up to London to work for my bread,
and if Heaven smiles on my <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>efforts I shall attain an honourable
independency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to your future plans, my child, more anon.&nbsp; For
the present my home must and shall be yours.&nbsp; When you have
recovered from the fatigue of your journey, I will endeavour to
obtain for you a situation in some respectable mercantile
house.&nbsp; You must in the meantime be my guest.&nbsp; I hope
happy days are in store for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth then rose from his couch (Mr. Jones had, during the
above conversation, been sitting on the ledge of the parapet by
his side), but when he attempted to move he almost fell down from
exhaustion.&nbsp; His newly found friend, who had intended to
have walked home, hailed a coach, which soon arrived at his
house, which was a semi-detached villa, in Brixton.</p>
<p>On their arrival, Mr. Jones introduced the youth to his wife
and only daughter.&nbsp; The former on being informed who he was,
welcomed him with affectionate cordiality.&nbsp; Mrs. Jones had
known his father and mother years ago, she being a native of a
village but a few miles from Wynn Castle.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>In
his new home Cadwgan spent an exceedingly pleasant evening.&nbsp;
He had to answer a thousand questions about people and families
who resided in the vicinity of his far distant home among the
mountains.&nbsp; At last he was permitted to retire to his room,
and having had no sound sleep for several nights, and being weary
and tired, was soon asleep.&nbsp; He awoke in the morning feeling
he was almost a new man.</p>
<p>At breakfast, Mr. Jones asked the youth what kind of
employment would best meet his wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indifferent, sir, as to the kind of situation; my
object and most anxious desire is to earn my living by hard
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely sorry, my young friend, that I have no
vacancy for a young gentleman of your talents and education in my
establishment.&nbsp; However, in the course of a few days I hope
to succeed in procuring you a situation in one of the great city
houses.&nbsp; In the meantime you are my guest.&nbsp; My wife and
daughter shall take you out during the day, in order to <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>show you
the lions of this great city; but in the evenings they must not
monopolize your whole attention, as I have much to say to you and
many inquiries to make about dear old friends in old Cambria,
which has been to us a good and kind mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
turning to his wife he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Be sure to take
particular care of our young visitor, and don&rsquo;t fail to
bring him back without injury to health or limb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need be under no apprehension on that point,
Owen,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Jones.&nbsp; &ldquo;No harm shall
befall him when under my charge.&nbsp; I shall guard him from
harm as if he were one of my own children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you will, wife.&nbsp; I must now leave
you.&nbsp; I hope you will spend a very pleasant day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones then left, and proceeded to his house of business;
but during his walk he thought, not of mercantile transaction or
of his dear old native land, oh, no: his thoughts were wholly
occupied with the adventure of the previous evening.</p>
<p>Soon after the departure of Mr. Jones, his wife <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>and
daughter and young Wynn started off for the purpose of seeing
some of the wonders of London, but the day closed before they saw
one hundredth part of its glories.&nbsp; Day after day they
continued to drive about from one part of the metropolis to
another, and during these excursions Cadwgan had acquired a
pretty accurate knowledge of the geography of London.</p>
<p>When at dinner on the following Sunday, Mr. Jones informed his
young visitor of his having at last succeeded in procuring for
him a situation as clerk in the old established house of Messrs.
Davies, Roberts &amp; Company, the celebrated tea merchants, and
that he was to commence his duties on the following Monday.&nbsp;
This information was exceedingly cheering to the youth, as the
certainty of employment was now assured.&nbsp; Not wishing to be
under obligation to his friends longer than he could possibly
help, he expressed a wish to procure lodgings in some respectable
family at once, and asked Mr. Jones if he knew of any place in
the neighbourhood likely to suit him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk on that matter, my boy, another <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>time,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jones.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the
present, at least, you must remain with us.&nbsp; If you do leave
us in the way you propose, remember, be your stay in London long
or short, you must consider our house your home.&nbsp; Before you
can possibly make any arrangements you must first see if the
situation will suit you; whether your employers like you, and you
like them.&nbsp; If you give them satisfaction, and your position
is likely to be permanent, why then we will, if you wish, permit
you to leave us; and I&rsquo;ve no doubt but that Mrs. Jones and
my daughter will find you comfortable apartments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m in your hands.&nbsp; You have
overpowered me with kindness which I shall never be able to
repay.&nbsp; When hungry, weary, and helpless, when friendless
and without a ray of hope, you came to me as an angel of mercy,
you took me into your house, and during my residence under your
hospitable roof, Mrs. Jones and you have treated me as if I were
your child.&nbsp; To you I shall always feel grateful; and come
what may, your image will ever repose in my heart of
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;Tut, tut! my boy, our kindness is nothing.&nbsp;
If we have succeeded in making you happy, and in giving you a
start in life, is not that a sufficient reward?&nbsp; But our
little attention requites in a very small degree the obligations
which I am under to your noble father&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; I am
still their debtor to an amount I shall never be able to
repay.&rdquo;</p>

155</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<i>THE VICTORY OF INNOCENCE</i>.</h3>
<p>The establishment of Messrs. Davies, Roberts &amp; Company,
was situated in one of those narrow streets, and was one of those
dark and dingy-looking buildings, which were far from being
uncommon in old London.&nbsp; The premises, however, were large
and commodious, and were specially adapted for their important
trade.&nbsp; When Cadwgan saw it for the first time, namely, on
the morning succeeding the conversation between Mr. Jones and
himself recorded in the previous chapter, he was painfully struck
with the contrast it presented with his own light and airy home,
surrounded as that home was by rich fields of pasture land and
trees of every kind and hue.&nbsp; However, he was by no means
disheartened, and was far from disposed to give up the contest in
life&rsquo;s battle without a struggle, so he entered the
building with his friend Mr. Jones cheerfully, and presently was
asked into <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>the presence of Mr. Roberts, the head of the firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the young gentleman you spoke to me about,
friend Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Mr. Cadwgan Wynn.&nbsp; I hope for the sake
of our common country and our friendship, that you will not be
unmindful of his interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His progress here, friend Jones, will depend wholly
upon himself.&nbsp; If he prove himself quick, painstaking, and
honest, he shall not want a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His honesty and rectitude I will guarantee; and
methinks as he comes from a shrewd stock, he will, with a few
years&rsquo; experience, prove a valuable hand,&mdash;one whom it
will be difficult for you to do without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am aware, Jones, that I can fully rely on your
recommendation.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Wynn, when will you be ready to go
into harness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am prepared, sir, to commence my duties at
once.&nbsp; If convenient for you to make arrangements,
I&rsquo;ll remain here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means remain.&nbsp; Come, follow me, <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>and I will
introduce you to Mr. McLiver, our chief cashier, in whose
department you will be engaged for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McLiver was a Scotchman, who had been in the service of
the firm many years.&nbsp; From almost the lowest place, he had
risen step by step until he attained the most important post in
the house.&nbsp; In him the firm had unbounded confidence, and as
he apparently managed his department with skill and economy Mr.
Roberts permitted him to select nearly the whole of the clerks
attached thereto.&nbsp; In less than two years from the date of
his appointment to his present post he had managed, by hook or by
crook, to get rid of nearly the whole of the old hands, and their
places he supplied with Scotchmen of his own kith and kin.&nbsp;
From the first day of entering the office, Mr. McLiver regarded
Cadwgan as an intruder, an interloper; hence he looked upon the
youth with aversion, and availed himself of every opportunity to
vex and annoy him.&nbsp; But this was not all.&nbsp; Any little
mistake Mr. Wynn might make in his books or accounts, was carried
to Mr. <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Roberts.&nbsp; But to these complaints he turned a deaf
ear, while at the same time he strictly enjoined upon Mr. McLiver
to take all possible care to have Cadwgan thoroughly instructed
in all business matters; above all, that he should be made a good
accountant.&nbsp; Though the Scotchman faithfully promised to
carry out to the letter his employer&rsquo;s instructions, yet he
intentionally refrained from doing so; while he continued to
annoy the youth by making personal allusions to his country, and
on more than one occasion he called him a Welsh blockhead.&nbsp;
Of his conduct Cadwgan never made any complaint, nor did he make
the slightest allusion to it, even to Mr. Jones.&nbsp; He worked
on, was constantly labouring at his books and accounts, and in
spite of the cashier he soon became a first-rate
accountant.&nbsp; Before he had been in the establishment five
years, he was the best man in the house as regarded profound
knowledge of intricate details.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fifth anniversary of his official
life, Mr. Roberts called Cadwgan into his private office, and
expressed to him the <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>high opinion he had formed of his
ability and character; and to his great surprise informed him
that being about to rearrange the work of the office, he had
resolved to divide the office work into sections, and that it was
his (Mr. Roberts&rsquo;) intention and wish that he should take
the position of chief accountant in the establishment, and that
there would be a number of clerks under him; that for the future
Mr. McLiver would simply receive moneys due to the firm, and pay
all demands against it, but all accounts must pass through the
hands of the accountants, which should bear the chief&rsquo;s
signature as being correct.</p>
<p>Cadwgan&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears on being apprized of
his promotion to so important a post, and he thanked Mr. Roberts
from his heart of hearts for his confidence and kindness.</p>
<p>The morning on which Mr. Wynn was to commence his new duties,
Mr. McLiver repaired to Mr. Roberts&rsquo; private office, where
he found that gentleman occupying his usual seat, engaged in
reading the money article of that morning&rsquo;s
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; Addressing that <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>gentleman in a somewhat peremptory
manner, he said he had just stepped in to ask if it was really
true that the young Welshman was to be placed in such an
important and responsible position in the establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true, Mr. McLiver.&nbsp; The appointment
has already been made, and in the opinion of my son and myself
Mr. Wynn has richly earned the post assigned him.&nbsp; We are of
opinion that, of all the clerks, he is by far the best qualified
to discharge the duties of the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But consider, sir, my many years of faithful service in
your house.&nbsp; I think that service merits some consideration
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is your wish, Mr. McLiver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wish, sir, is, that you confer this appointment upon
my cousin.&nbsp; He has been longer in your employ than Wynn, and
I am sure he possesses ability far superior to that of this young
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite impossible, Mr. McLiver.&nbsp; Mr.
Wynn&rsquo;s appointment has already been made, and he has been
duly informed of <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>my resolve.&nbsp; In fact he has accepted our
offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, sir, I fear I must send in my
resignation.&nbsp; I could not think of having my books and
accounts overhauled by this intruder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave, sir, if you wish; and I will give you a
cheque for your quarter&rsquo;s salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I right then in concluding you have lost confidence
in me?&nbsp; Are you desirous that the connection between us be
severed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, sir.&nbsp; If you leave, it will be your
own act and deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you wish me to remain in your service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, Mr. McLiver.&nbsp; But you will bear in
mind that all my arrangements and plans must be carried out to
the letter.&nbsp; There must be no divided authority here, so
long as I&rsquo;m master.&nbsp; I desire you to confine yourself,
wholly, to the duties of your department, which require your
undivided attention; and I will be answerable for the <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>proper
discharge of the duties of the new accountant&rsquo;s
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bow to your decision, Mr. Roberts, and hope you will
not have any cause to regret the arrangements you have
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that, sir, time will tell.&nbsp; You, Mr. McLiver,
will not have to make up my loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McLiver, finding it was useless to press the matter further,
wished his chief good morning, and returned to his own office in
a very bad humour.</p>
<p>On entering, he uttered the most awful imprecations against
Welshmen in general, and Mr. Wynn in particular.&nbsp; He swore
that he would be revenged.&nbsp; He turned to his cousin, and
thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is owing to you, you d&mdash;d scoundrel, that I owe
my present disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, sir!&nbsp; What the d&mdash;l do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, Donald, that if you had been steady and honest
and plodding, this calamity would not have befallen our
clan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;A fellow must have a spree, McLiver, now and
then.&nbsp; That is human nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n human nature!&nbsp; Donald, you talk like a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you, cousin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m truly
sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a d&mdash;d bad job for me, that you have
indulged in dissipation to the extent you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But old Roberts has paid the piper, Mac, though he
little suspects it.&nbsp; He is little aware where the money
comes from to keep up your grand establishment.&nbsp; If he knew
all wouldn&rsquo;t there be a jolly blow up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You son of paupers, you parish &rsquo;prentice, if you
talk to me in that way I&rsquo;ll knock your b&mdash;y head off
your shoulders, by G&mdash;d I&rsquo;ll do it, though you be my
father&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, cousin; it won&rsquo;t do for thee and me
to quarrel and fall out now.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve sailed too long in
the same boat&mdash;I mean, we&rsquo;ve dipped our fingers too
deeply in the same till to peach upon each other, or to <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>quarrel.&nbsp; Methinks our present duty is to guard
against being found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your advice is good, Donald; but that our delinquencies
will come to the knowledge of old Roberts, d&mdash;n him, is a
matter of certainty.&nbsp; That young Welsh nincompoop imp has
his eyes everywhere; his ears are always open.&nbsp; I should not
be at all surprised even if our present talk reached him.&nbsp;
For us it was an evil day when he came here.&nbsp; If I were sure
of not being found out, I&rsquo;d soon put an end to his
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad as I am, cousin, I&rsquo;d not commit murder.&nbsp;
That we must not do.&nbsp; Our best plan is to concoct some
scheme to dethrone this upstart.&nbsp; Old Roberts has willed he
should reign over us; be it our mission to bring him to the
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good suggestion, Donald.&nbsp; By gam! we must take
care, though, to lay the snare well so as to be certain of our
bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>During several months succeeding the above conversation the
business of the house of Davies, <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Roberts &amp; Company went on in its
usual quiet way, but in those months the young Welshman and his
staff had succeeded in overhauling the books of the firm for
several years.&nbsp; At the accounts they had worked night and
day.&nbsp; When the investigation had been completed his clerks
knew nothing about the result, nor indeed of the object which
they had in view in making so strict an investigation.&nbsp; So
far Mr. Wynn had discovered defalcations amounting to nearly
&pound;20,000, though the bottom of the peculation had not yet
been reached.&nbsp; The books showed that McLiver had carried on
his swindling in a regularly systematic manner, and had escaped
detection for the reason that all his subordinates, which made up
nearly the whole staff, were creatures of his
own&mdash;principally his own kith and kin.&nbsp; When Cadwgan
had completed his labours, he had ascertained, beyond the shadow
of a doubt, that the amount abstracted was &pound;24,500.&nbsp;
During the months he had been engaged in auditing the books,
Cadwgan had made certain inquiries of houses with which his
employers had had business <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>transactions, so he was in a
position to prove by written evidence the particulars and the
exact sum of each fraudulent transaction.&nbsp; These inquiries
had been carried on privately; neither to Mr. Roberts, nor to any
member of his staff, had he let fall a word calculated to awaken
suspicion.&nbsp; It was late on a Saturday night when Cadwgan
finished his labours.&nbsp; When descending from his office down
to the large entrance hall, with his papers in his hand, he was
surprised to find Mr. McLiver and his cousin Donald there.&nbsp;
They did not stop to speak, but passed on into their own
office.&nbsp; As they heard Mr. Wynn, before he descended, shut
his office door and lock it, they naturally concluded he was the
last person in the buildings.&nbsp; Presently, McLiver and Donald
left the house together, the porter closing the door on their
descending into the street.</p>
<p>That evening was anxiously spent by Mr. Wynn.&nbsp; He retired
to rest late, but slept not.&nbsp; That the facts he possessed
would be most damaging to his arch-enemy there could be no doubt;
that he might possibly be the means of <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>saving his
employers from being ruined, was in his judgment equally
certain.</p>
<p>On the following Sunday morning Cadwgan paid a visit to his
friend Mr. Owen Jones, to whom he revealed the state of affairs
of the firm.&nbsp; Mr. Jones was a man of the world, and,
moreover, was a wise and sagacious man of business.&nbsp; After
talking over the matter, it was arranged that Mr. Jones should
accompany his young friend to the establishment of Messrs.
Davies, Roberts &amp; Company the next morning, when the whole
facts should be placed before Mr. Roberts.</p>
<p>On their arrival at the establishment on Monday morning, Mr.
Jones and Cadwgan at once went to Mr. Roberts&rsquo; private
office, when that gentleman looked at Mr. Wynn with a hard and
scowling brow.&nbsp; As Mr. Jones had always experienced the
greatest kindness from Mr. Roberts (they had been more like
brothers than friends), he was surprised and astonished in
observing his altered look, and boldly asked the cause of his
seeming displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cause, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Roberts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>you say cause!&nbsp; There is methinks enough of
cause!&nbsp; To be robbed of &pound;3000 by this young man, whom
you introduced to me, for whom I have done so much, whose
interest and welfare I have done so much to
promote&mdash;&rsquo;tis enough to make me curse the day on which
I was weak and foolish enough to comply with your pressing
request to take him into my service.&nbsp; Cause, indeed!&nbsp;
To be robbed thus is a sufficient cause for my anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say, sir,&rdquo; remarked Cadwgan, &ldquo;that
I had robbed you of &pound;3000?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I said so.&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t deny
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I emphatically deny your charge, sir, and demand the
name of my accuser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accuse you, sir.&nbsp; Is not that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Roberts, you are a just man, and I presume you
will not condemn me before placing in my possession the evidence
upon which your judgment rests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My informant, sir, is my confidential clerk, Mr.
McLiver.&nbsp; He is prepared to swear to the fact of your being
the robber, and his cousin Donald will corroborate his
statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>McLiver was then summoned by Mr. Roberts; and in reply
to his inquiries stated, that on the previous Saturday evening he
and his cousin had secreted themselves in the house, that during
the time they were in their hiding-place Mr. Wynn came down from
his own room and went into the cashier&rsquo;s office, and by
means of false keys opened the safe and rifled the drawers of
their contents, which he put into a bag, then retired.&nbsp; He
continued to say, that he and his cousin waited there some time,
that Mr. Wynn went back to his own office, and afterwards came
down stairs with the bag in his hand, which was so heavy that he
was almost weighed down.&nbsp; He left the office taking the bag
of gold with him.&nbsp; Donald corroborated his cousin&rsquo;s
statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, as was natural, appeared much excited during the
Scotchman&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; He almost believed in his
young friend&rsquo;s guilt, because the evidence was so direct
and circumstantial.&nbsp; Mr. Wynn stood calm and collected; he
never moved during the few minutes which the delivery of the
evidence against him occupied, though his dark piercing eye,
intently <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>fixed upon McLiver, made that man quail beneath its
penetrating glance.&nbsp; When they had finished their story, Mr.
Wynn asked his employer&rsquo;s permission to call evidence in
his favour,&mdash;a request which was readily acceded to, because
he really loved the youth.&nbsp; He then called into the office,
one by one, six of his confidential clerks, the gentlemen who had
been specially engaged with him in investigating the old
accounts, who, in reply to his question, said that Mr. Wynn never
left the office until his final departure, which was very late,
and that they watched him going out though unperceived.&nbsp; The
care-taker gave evidence that Mr. Wynn did not return after his
departure.&nbsp; When they had completed the evidence, Mr.
McLiver asked, &ldquo;And what were you doing at the office that
time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were engaged in making copies of important documents
for Mr. Wynn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of those?&rdquo; asked Mr. Roberts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were all put, sir, into Mr. Wynn&rsquo;s
bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who put them into the bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Williams.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;Was the bag locked, Mr. Williams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it was locked; and the key has been in my
possession since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we examine the contents of the bag I wish to
know if you are quite sure that Mr. Wynn did not leave the office
during any portion of the evening, that is, before his final
departure; and that you and your fellow-clerks saw him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They replied, that they were prepared to make oath on the
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you watch his departure?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Roberts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had overheard a conversation,&rdquo; said Mr.
Williams, the clerk of Mr. Wynn&rsquo;s department,
&ldquo;between Mr. McLiver and his cousin Donald, in which
certain threatening words were used towards Mr. Wynn.&nbsp; We
watched his departure, thinking it quite possible that they might
be lurking about the buildings in order to effect his
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When McLiver and Donald heard the above evidence they became
agitated, and their faces became as white as snow.&nbsp; Mr.
Roberts scarcely knew what to do.&nbsp; After considering a few
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>minutes,
he turned to McLiver, saying, &ldquo;I fear your tale is untrue;
for these six gentlemen, whom I have always found truthful and
honourable, have in the most direct manner flatly contradicted
you in every particular.&nbsp; I hope you and your cousin have
not conspired to injure this young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have hit the right nail on the head this
time,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones, &ldquo;and no mistake.&nbsp; But is
this &pound;3000 the whole of your loss, friend
Roberts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole as far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy man! what a blessed thing it is to be rich, and
unable to reckon up the whole of one&rsquo;s profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, Jones,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Roberts
pettishly, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t like to lose
&pound;3000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, my friend, you will find your loss not
&pound;3000, but nine times three, if the &pound;3000 has really
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you really mean, Jones?&nbsp; You appear to
know more of my affairs than I know myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few words, I mean to say, Roberts, that <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>that
immaculate gentleman, the accuser of my young friend here, who is
also the best friend you ever had, has robbed you to the tune of
some &pound;25,000, in addition to this &pound;3000; for I
presume he has taken that sum too; and Mr. Wynn has evidence in
his bag,&mdash;it is still locked,&mdash;which will completely
substantiate the fact.&nbsp; When you know the whole,
you&rsquo;ll bless the day, friend Roberts, on which my child was
introduced into your establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present we will suspend our judgment.&nbsp;
Jones, Mr. Wynn, all of you, go to Mr. Wynn&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
We will compare Mr. Wynn&rsquo;s papers with our ledgers and day
books.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bag was unlocked, and paper after paper
was produced, and document after document submitted for
inspection and comparison.&nbsp; Cadwgan detailed step by step
his proceedings in order to ascertain the exact sum total of the
money abstracted by Mr. McLiver and Donald.&nbsp; After he had
gone through these, he produced the documents and vouchers he had
collected from firms with which Messrs. Davies, Roberts &amp;
Company had had transactions, and on being compared <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>with the
ledger, it was found that in many cases the actual sum paid to
merchants for goods did not amount to a moiety of the sum
inserted in the ledger.&nbsp; The evidence of McLiver&rsquo;s
guilt was overwhelming.&nbsp; When Mr. Roberts saw this, he took
Mr. Wynn into his arms, embraced him as if he was his own child,
and with tears in his eyes besought his pardon for having for a
moment entertained suspicions of his honesty and rectitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter to me is now made plain.&nbsp; The real
culprit is the man whom I regarded as upright, pure, and
honest.&nbsp; He has shamefully abused my confidence.&nbsp; To
him I entrusted my money; and what, sir,&rdquo; turning to
McLiver, &ldquo;have you to say in your defence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will neither acknowledge nor deny my guilt, sir, in
the presence of that Welsh puppy, who is a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing, a caitiff cut-throat miscreant, a cunning, intriguing,
and deceitful urchin from the Welsh mountains.&nbsp; When he
meets me and Donald in the street, I promise him he shall be well
paid for his treachery and circumvention.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; said Mr. Roberts, &ldquo;on
condition you leave me a free man.&nbsp; For the present, sir,
you must consider yourself and your cousin&mdash;I believe him to
be equally guilty with yourself&mdash;in the hands of the
authorities.&nbsp; The officers of justice are now in an
adjoining room.&nbsp; They are there awaiting my orders.&nbsp;
There is no occasion to detain them, as your guilt is but too
clearly made out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was then opened, and McLiver and Donald were placed
in their charge, and were marched off to prison.</p>
<p>On the room being cleared of the presence of all excepting Mr.
Jones and Cadwgan, Mr. Roberts asked the latter how he had
succeeded in making such important discoveries, and the reason
which had moved him in entering upon an investigation which had
cost him and his staff so much time and labour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time, sir, I have firmly believed in his
dishonesty.&nbsp; In the first place, and this fact first
awakened my suspicion, I, by means which it is unnecessary for me
to detail, ascertained that he was keeping a grand house, and <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>had livery
servants and carriages, and gave grand parties, which I knew he
could not do with &pound;400 a year.&nbsp; His cousin, Donald, is
a fast young man who spent his earnings in dissipation, and for
years has been the constant companion of young men who are
believed to live by swindling their respective employers.&nbsp;
On making these discoveries, Mr. Sykes, who is an honest
Yorkshireman, and my friend Mr. Williams, resolved to take
special notice of their movements, and wisely kept records of
what they saw and heard, which could at any time be produced in
the event of anything turning up.&nbsp; We discovered first, that
tea had been bought by your house of a very inferior quality,
which was paid for at double the actual invoice price, and in
some cases the charge was sixty per cent above the actual
cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Wynn, how did he manage this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, easily enough, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found by inquiry, that McLiver had two relatives as
cashiers in the houses with which you did business; and as all
moneys <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>passed through their hands, they could commit frauds to
almost any extent without fear of being detected.&nbsp; They had
confederates, so by acting together had but little difficulty in
carrying out their system of plunder, especially as the books and
accounts were under their control.&nbsp; When you made your new
arrangements, they, that is, Mr. McLiver and Donald, were
apprehensive that disclosures would be made, and you will
remember, sir, that McLiver almost protested against your
scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I well remember, Mr. Wynn, that he was terribly angry,
but little did I then think that its cause originated in
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the appointment had been made, and we had entered
upon our duties, Mr. Sykes ascertained&mdash;in short he
overheard a conversation between the two in which certain threats
were made towards me, and in that conversation McLiver and Donald
upbraided each other about their peculation.&nbsp; We had thus
sufficient evidence to warrant us in concluding that they had
robbed you.&nbsp; Having <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>discovered this, we then planned the
investigation, which has occupied our evenings ever since.&nbsp;
It was late on Saturday night when we arrived at the final
result.&nbsp; The rest you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Cadwgan, I know the rest.&nbsp; In the
presence of my dear and valued friend Jones, I offer you my
humblest apology for having suspected you of dishonesty; I shall
never be able to repay you for the services you have rendered
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m repaid already by your confidence and
esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hereafter, Mr. Wynn, I will seek to do so in a more
substantial way.&nbsp; But tell me, what can you possibly know
about the quality of tea?&nbsp; You remarked just now it was
inferior; how did you ascertain this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the quality of teas by the smell.&rdquo; <a
name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;By the smell!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&ldquo;Yes, sir; by the smell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two samples: please give me your judgment upon
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wynn took the samples, and having smelt them, returned
them to his employer, saying, this is worth so much, the other
sample is not worth buying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Wynn, I am satisfied, and more than
satisfied, with your conduct during the years you have been in
our house.&nbsp; For your goodness, and the deep interest you
have taken in all matters connected with my affairs, from the
bottom of my heart I thank you.&nbsp; You are necessarily
agitated by reason of the scene through which you have just
passed.&nbsp; You must be fatigued too by reason of the extra
work you have, for my sake, imposed upon yourself.&nbsp; I cannot
now say in what way I shall reward you, but if you and friend
Jones will come and dine at my house (bring Mrs. Jones and your
daughter with you), I will then tell you the course I shall <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>adopt, and
the arrangements I propose to make with reference to your
position and prospects.&nbsp; Your disinterested service calls
for an ample reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I require no reward, Mr. Roberts,&rdquo; said
Cadwgan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have simply done my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Mr. Wynn, you may think so.&nbsp; You must
not, however, condemn me for holding the contrary
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should esteem it a favour, sir, if you would give Mr.
Sykes and Mr. Williams a holiday.&nbsp; They are not well, and I
fear the pressure upon them during the past few weeks has
overtaxed their strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means let them go.&nbsp; Please give them this,
and tell them it is a small token of my high appreciation of
their conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wynn was delighted at being made the channel of Mr.
Roberts&rsquo;s communication.&nbsp; When the papers were opened,
it was found that they were two &pound;10 Bank of England
notes.&nbsp; On receiving the gift, the Yorkshireman held it up,
and said,&mdash;&ldquo;I little expected this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Williams, too, was equally surprised.&nbsp; They <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>then wished
each other good morning, and it need hardly be said that Mr.
Wynn&rsquo;s assistants thoroughly enjoyed their day&rsquo;s trip
to Windsor.</p>

<i>THE RIGHT MAN COMING AT THE RIGHT TIME</i>.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not strange, dear aunt,&rdquo; said Gwenfan,
&ldquo;that Cadwgan has been so long silent?&nbsp; We have not
heard from him for more than a month.&nbsp; He might just have
sent a line to say he was well, and when we may expect
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cadwgan, my dear child, has now a great deal to
do.&nbsp; Since his promotion, doubtless his time is fully
occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see a likeness of the young lady to
whom he refers in his letters.&nbsp; If the description he gives
be anything approaching the truth, she must be queen both in
personal appearance and purity of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you refer to Miss Jones, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, aunt bach; I refer certainly to her.&nbsp; I think
my naughty brother is in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be an excellent match, Gwenfan, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>for Miss
Jones is an only child of very rich parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not aware, aunt, that Mr. Jones was a person of
great wealth, though I thought he was well to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said, that her papa will give her &pound;50,000
on the morning of her marriage, with the certainty of farther
expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should like to see Cadwgan settled, if he had a
kind, good, and loving wife.&nbsp; For myself, aunty, I intend to
remain single, and be like you, an old maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do, do you?&nbsp; You will alter your opinion,
I&rsquo;ll be bound when the right man comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will the right man come, aunty?&nbsp; Never, never,
say I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the right man will certainly come, Gwenfan.&nbsp; I
declare there he is.&nbsp; Look! look! be quick!&nbsp; Why, he is
coming here.&nbsp; If you wish to escape his net, fly, my niece,
at once to your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly?&nbsp; I will not do that, aunty,&rdquo; said
Gwenfan, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though perhaps we had better
retire and prepare ourselves to receive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;Well thought of, my child; and tell the servant,
if he seeks us, to show him into the drawing-room, where we will
presently join him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the servant opened the door, the young gentleman inquired
if Miss Wynn were within, as he wished to see her on a matter of
some importance.&nbsp; Receiving a reply in the affirmative, the
servant conducted the stranger to the drawing-room, on entering
which he took a seat in the great bay-window, from which he gazed
on the glorious prospect around.&nbsp; So enchanted was he with
the sight, the exquisite beauty of the scene, that he did not
notice the entrance of the ladies, who had been a few minutes in
the room before he became aware of their presence.&nbsp; At last
Miss Aunt Wynn approached the chair on which he was seated, when
the ruffle of her dress awoke him from his reverie.&nbsp; He then
rose, apologised for his abrupt visit, but excused himself by
saying that circumstances had occurred which had compelled him to
alter his original arrangement, hence he found himself there two
days earlier than he had expected.</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;But ladies, in my having to apologise, I forget
to introduce myself.&nbsp; My name is Rhys Roberts, and I
presume,&rdquo; pointing to the young lady standing by her
aunt&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;that she is your niece, Miss Gwenfan
Wynn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; this young lady is my niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&nbsp; She is the very image of her
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know my brother?&rdquo; asked Gwenfan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him!&nbsp; He is my father&rsquo;s chief hand, and
my most intimate friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you see or hear from my brother,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I left London, we arranged to meet here.&nbsp; I
have been expecting a letter from him daily, but no letter has
reached me.&nbsp; I cannot think what has become of him.&nbsp; It
is quite possible he may be detained on important business.&nbsp;
He had a very important matter in hand when I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not heard from him,&rdquo; said the aunt,
&ldquo;for a month, and his sister and I are getting very anxious
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;You need not, ladies, be in any alarm.&nbsp;
During the last month, he has been working night and day, and has
had scarcely a moment to spare.&nbsp; He has now completed his
labours, so on Monday, or on Tuesday next at the farthest, you
may expect him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, we shall have the pleasure of your
company until his arrival,&rdquo; remarked the aunt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My nephew&rsquo;s friend will ever receive here a hearty
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely obliged to you, madam, for your
kind offer of hospitality, and as I wish, and am most anxious, to
pay a visit to the most remarkable places in your neighbourhood,
I embrace your kind offer, if you and Miss Gwenfan will promise
to act as my cicerones, as doubtless you are thoroughly
acquainted with every nook and corner of the country where the
beauteous spots are to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall, sir,&rdquo; said the ladies, &ldquo;be
delighted to show you the most romantic spots to be found in wild
Wales.&nbsp; For grandeur and bold scenery our neighbourhood has
no equal.&nbsp; But, Mr. Roberts, you must judge for
yourself.&nbsp; When you <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>have traversed our mountains and
valleys, our high hills and sylvan glades, you will say that the
beauties of the surrounding scene are beyond the descriptive
powers of the most eloquent pen of this age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the few days of their tour, they visited Bettws-y-Coed,
Capel Curig, the Swallow Falls, Pont Aberglaslyn, Llyngwynant,
Tan y Bwlch, Maentwrog, Ffestiniog, Rhayadr Dd&ucirc;, Tremadoc,
Harlech, and Aberdovy, returning late on Saturday night from the
latter town.&nbsp; Both the ladies and Mr. Roberts had thoroughly
enjoyed their outing; the latter especially, having now for the
first time beheld the scenes, was charmed with the grand sights
which he had beheld.</p>
<p>During this excursion there had sprung up, unconsciously to
himself, a feeling of more than respect for Miss Gwenfan, whilst
she and her aunt concluded that Mr. Roberts was one of the most
kind-hearted, generous, and amiable young gentlemen with whom
they had ever come in contact.&nbsp; It must, too, be owned that
Mr. Roberts had awakened in her young heart emotions of a kind,
and in a degree, to <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>which that heart had been previously
a stranger.</p>
<p>When Mr. Roberts retired to his dressing-room he wrote in his
diary the following sentence: &ldquo;Happy, thrice happy, will be
the man who secures such a prize as Miss Gwenfan!&nbsp; In her
heart is lodged the deepest reverence for truth, for virtue, and
religion.&nbsp; She is, too, as beautiful as she is good.&nbsp;
Her attachment to and admiration of her native country and its
people is as deep and as enthusiastic as was that of the glorious
old patriots of olden times.&nbsp; Then the days I have passed in
her society have been the happiest I ever spent.&nbsp; I can
hardly realize the happiness I have enjoyed.&nbsp; They are like
a dream, though in the foreground of the vision there stands the
good and beautiful maiden, with her curly locks, her auburn hair,
her dark eye, and a countenance as clear as the crystal
streamlet.&nbsp; In spite of myself I love her.&nbsp; I now
retire to rest.&nbsp; May her dreams be as pleasant as I hope
mine will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At breakfast, on the following Sabbath <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>morning,
Mr. Roberts asked the ladies if they would accompany him to the
Methodist Church, at Tan y Bwlch, as he was particularly desirous
of hearing the Rev. Thomas Charles, of Bala, who at that time was
considered one of the most eminent clergymen in Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate, Mr. Roberts, you put the question to
us,&rdquo; replied the ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have simply anticipated us in your
request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had arranged to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, conditionally on your accompanying us to hear that
great and good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted, madam, in the prospect of seeing and
hearing one so distinguished for learning and piety, one who has
made so many sacrifices for the spiritual welfare of his
countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their arrival at the church they found it crammed to
suffocation, scarcely a single inch remained unoccupied.&nbsp;
However, as the Misses Wynn and Mr. Roberts came in a carriage,
and Bryn Villa being always open to receive <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>clergymen
of this and all other denominations, the deacons managed to find
them seats.&nbsp; Mr. Charles&rsquo; discourse was above the
average; some of the passages were most eloquent, and many
members of the congregation were bathed in tears.</p>
<p>On their way home Mr. Roberts referred to a passage in Mr.
Charles&rsquo; sermon, which he considered most beautiful.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You remember he said, &lsquo;implicitly to follow the
counsel of the best and wisest of men, is to depend on an arm of
flesh.&nbsp; They only are right and safe who make God&rsquo;s
glory their end, God&rsquo;s word their rule, God&rsquo;s spirit
the guide of their actions, and God&rsquo;s providence the guide
of their affairs.&nbsp; They may not be led by the nearest, but
they will be by the best road; as it will certainly appear when
they come to their journey&rsquo;s end.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the
Christian Church, and if all religious people were to act
according to Mr. Charles&rsquo; sublime idea, the race would be
happier than it is.&nbsp; The standard he set before us is a high
one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found it difficult to live up to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>&ldquo;I have no doubt you have, Mr. Roberts,&rdquo;
remarked the aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must, however, do our best,
then Heaven will surely smile upon us, though we but imperfectly
perform our religious duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that thought, madam, which cheers me in my hour
of gloom and sadness.&nbsp; I often think that I should have
given up striving to live to God were it not for the glorious
promises He has given His Church and people.&nbsp; In my
endeavour to attain to the highest form of spiritual life, your
nephew, Miss Wynn, your dear brother, Miss Gwenfan, has helped me
by his wise counsel, while his deep religiousness and high
Christian character have been incentives to me to aspire to reach
the highest good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reference to her brother brought tears to Gwenfan&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; Ever since he had left home, she had prayed every
night and morning that he might be kept from evil, kept unspotted
from the world, kept safely in the pavilion of the unseen and
eternal.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts, seeing the young lady in tears, <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>asked if he
could in any way alleviate her sorrow; but she at once
replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I weep not, sir, because my heart is sad.&nbsp; I am
almost overcome with joy by reason of your reference to dear
Cadwgan.&nbsp; Oh, I do rejoice with unspeakable satisfaction,
that he has not forgotten the holy lessons our dear parents
taught us.&nbsp; Though they are gone, I feel their spirits often
visit us, and I think they watch over us with the same care and
solicitude as when they were present in the flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy, my dear Miss Wynn, must be the brother whose
beloved sister, living here amongst the Welsh mountains, prays
daily for his welfare.&nbsp; I can bear testimony to his
practical piety, his eminent godliness, his deep devotional
spirit.&nbsp; He has taught me to love and adore the Name which
is above every name.&nbsp; There is, too, a fragrance about
Cadwgan&rsquo;s acts and life.&nbsp; Truly has he been the guide
of my inexperience, my counsellor, my friend.&nbsp; During the
past three years, scarcely a day has passed without our having <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>conversation on the highest things.&nbsp; Since we
parted the other day, I have missed him much.&nbsp; Oh, I wish he
had come!&nbsp; But there <i>is</i> your brother.&nbsp;
Look!&nbsp; He is waiting our return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment afterward Cadwgan and his sister were locked in
each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>During the following week Miss Gwenfan Wynn and Mr. Roberts
were almost constantly together; and it must be owned that there
grew up between those two young and innocent hearts a feeling
more warm, more ardent, and more fervent than usually exists
between friends and acquaintances; a feeling which if permitted
to ripen and develop, would result in the union of heart with
heart, soul with soul,&mdash;a feeling the intensity of which
would survive even the tomb.</p>
<p>After the happy days thus spent together, Miss Wynn one
evening remarked to her niece, &ldquo;Has not the right man come,
my child?&nbsp; I suppose I shall hear no more of your living the
life of an old maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aunt, you are too cruel.&nbsp; I like Mr. Roberts
much, but only as Cadwgan&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;Well, well; we shall see what we shall
see.&nbsp; You will be Mrs. Roberts one of these days.&nbsp;
There, don&rsquo;t blush my child.&nbsp; There is no harm in your
loving so noble a youth.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<i>VIRTUE REWARDED</i>.</h3>
<p>On leaving the warehouse one evening, soon after his return
from Wales, Mr. Roberts remarked, &ldquo;You must dine with us
to-morrow, Mr. Wynn, and my old friend Jones will accompany
you.&nbsp; He has already arranged to form one of our party, and
I am glad for my own sake and yours that we shall have the
pleasure of his society.&nbsp; He is one of the best men I know
in this huge city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the ladies had retired, Mr. Roberts pushed the
bottle to Mr. Jones, with the observation, &ldquo;This is your
favourite wine, and please to make yourself as free with it as
you&rsquo;re welcome.&nbsp; I think Mr. Wynn and you, my son,
prefer sherry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try port, which is my favourite
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a general conversation on the general topics of the day,
Mr. Roberts turned to Mr. <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Jones, and said that he thanked him
most gratefully for having pleaded so eloquently the claims of
his young friend, Wynn.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will doubtless remember,
Jones, that I was most unwilling to receive him into the
establishment, in the first place on his own account; secondly, I
did not consider mine a proper place for a young gentleman of his
social position.&nbsp; You, however, urged his claims, and
considering our personal friendship, and my previous connection
with the Wynn family, I at last reluctantly yielded to your
wishes, though in doing so I was perfectly aware that I should
create in the mind of McLiver hostile feelings to myself and
Cadwgan there.&nbsp; I little expected that my cashier&rsquo;s
objection would spring from conviction of wrongdoing.&nbsp; I
believed in his integrity, and had confidence in his honesty; and
as he apparently served me faithfully I was prepared to yield to
some extent to his wishes, though he was well aware of my
unbending disposition when once I had resolved to carry a
particular point.&nbsp; McLiver having discovered my resolve to
be Mr. Wynn&rsquo;s friend, I must <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>own that he did not oppose my wishes
to the extent I at first anticipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now from the first day on which Mr. Wynn entered upon
his duties, I am bound to say that I found him plodding,
persevering, and honest; his first and chief concern being to
promote my interest.&nbsp; In this, he set us all an example we
should do well to copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the proceedings of the other day&mdash;a day which
to me will be ever memorable, I will not allude further than to
express a hope that I have Cadwgan&rsquo;s complete pardon for
having for once suspected his dishonesty.&nbsp; And this is a
fitting occasion for me to thank you, Jones, for the deep
interest you have shown in my affairs in connection with our
young friend.&nbsp; Had Cadwgan not done what he did, the
scoundrel&rsquo;s rascality would in all probability have
effected my ruin.&nbsp; But how came you, Mr. Wynn, to suspect
his dishonesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tale, sir, is soon told,&rdquo; remarked
Cadwgan.&nbsp; &ldquo;From time to time little things cropped up
in connection with business transactions and in the accounts, the
appearance of <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>which I did not at all like.&nbsp; To my mind there was
satisfactory and conclusive evidence that the man was not dealing
honourably by you, and that you were a victim of his
dishonesty.&nbsp; You must bear in mind this, I had but a
suspicion.&nbsp; I could not prove that what I suspected was
actual and real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being in a state of doubt, I really did not know what
to do.&nbsp; I could not suggest my suspicion to you because the
person was in your confidence.&nbsp; After thinking over the
matter some days and nights I resolved to sound my fellow-clerks,
Messrs. Sykes and Williams, for I knew I could depend on
them.&nbsp; Strange to say they had long suspected his guilt, but
were afraid to give expression to their opinion, because Mr.
McLiver appeared all-powerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a conference we agreed to get up evidence.&nbsp;
We ascertained he was living at the rate of &pound;2000 or
&pound;3000 a year, though he had no income but his salary.&nbsp;
We found, too, that he paid for all goods when ordered.&nbsp; On
making further inquiry we discovered that his cousin Donald,
though he had a smaller <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>salary than I had, spent several
pounds weekly in dissipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the constant visits of relatives who are employed
in similar establishments in the city, and the worthless stuff
sent from the houses where they were engaged, these things
awakened in my mind the strongest suspicion that the parties were
conspiring together to rob you and their employers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the books were all in McLiver&rsquo;s hands and
under his control, we could do nothing; but when you appointed me
to the post of accountant, Mr. Sykes, Mr. Williams, and myself
resolved to ascertain if our suspicion was well founded.&nbsp;
During the past three months we have given the whole of our spare
time during the day to the past five years&rsquo; accounts, while
we seldom left the office until late at night.&nbsp; The result
of our labours you know.&nbsp; I fancy one of the clerks in my
department must have told McLiver what we were doing, and
doubtless his guilt awoke in his mind a sense of the dangerous
position in which he had placed himself.&nbsp; Then in order if
possible <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>to crush me before the work was done, he and his cousin
Donald concocted the charge against me&mdash;themselves being the
robbers.&nbsp; I do not for a moment think they wished my
punishment.&nbsp; What they did desire was to secure my expulsion
from your establishment, that thus their malpractices might
possibly remain undetected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are his relations employed, Mr. Wynn?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Roberts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McNab, his uncle, is cashier to the Chinese Tea
Company, and his brother is with Morant &amp;
Hogsflesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe these parties were
confederates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case what would you advise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In justice to yourself and the high reputation of your
house, it is your duty to furnish them with the whole of our
discovered facts.&nbsp; It is important they should be informed
of their servants&rsquo; dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gad, Mr. Wynn, I&rsquo;ll advise their punishment;
and if their employers won&rsquo;t do it, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;I am afraid that your advice will be too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so, Cadwgan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both have already fled to the Continent.&nbsp; It
appears that they, like McLiver, helped themselves to their
employers&rsquo; money before they went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did they find out McLiver was in prison, Mr.
Wynn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one of your servants or clerks must have carried
the news to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the scoundrels back, cost what it
will.&nbsp; To-morrow the officers of justice shall fly in
pursuit.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll find them somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, sir, they deserve severe punishment, though I
am sorry for McNab, because he has a large family, and in
punishing him you will punish his innocent wife and
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They, Mr. Wynn, shall not come to want.&nbsp; While
resolving to punish the guilty, I&rsquo;ll see to the interests
of the guiltless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand, friend Roberts,&rdquo; said Mr.
Jones.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a noble fellow; your <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>heart is in
the right place; and I&rsquo;ll join you in so holy a
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must now turn,&rdquo; said Mr. Roberts, &ldquo;to a
more pleasant theme.&nbsp; It has been by you, Mr. Wynn, I have
been saved from ruin.&nbsp; You have business talents of a high
order.&nbsp; I would trust you with untold gold.&nbsp; You have
proved your fidelity and tact under circumstances the most
trying.&nbsp; In our relationship I plainly see the finger of
Heaven.&nbsp; I now plainly see that it is my interest no less
than your own that our relationship should be closer than it has
hitherto been.&nbsp; The business, as you are aware, is wholly my
own.&nbsp; Thank Heaven, I possess all the wealth I desire.&nbsp;
However, I love work, and at present I&rsquo;m not quite prepared
to throw off the harness.&nbsp; I shall do so, however, in a few
years.&nbsp; In view of that day I think it well to prepare for
it.&nbsp; I have therefore resolved to take into partnership my
son Rhys and you, and we&rsquo;ll take equal profits.&nbsp; The
money in the business I shall regard as a set-off against your
ability and talent, and when I go out I will leave in your <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>joint hands
the capital necessary for successfully carrying on the
concern.&nbsp; Are you prepared, Mr. Wynn, to accept my
offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With deep gratitude and thanks I do indeed accept your
offer, Mr. Roberts.&nbsp; I shall never be able to repay you for
your goodness and kindness.&nbsp; To me you have been always
kind, always generous, ever noble and disinterested.&nbsp; To Mr.
Jones and you I owe my present position and the prospects before
me.&nbsp; My gratitude, sir, I shall carry with me to the
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rejoice,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Jones, who had hitherto
been an almost silent listener, &ldquo;to see this day, and I
shall pray Heaven that the sun of prosperity may ever continue to
shine on your concern, and that never an incident may occur
calculated to disturb the kindly feeling and mutual confidence
between you, friend Roberts, and your new partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that, Jones, I say amen.&nbsp; Still I think there
is not much danger on that score.&nbsp; We all know each other;
that&rsquo;s an important point.&nbsp; Unless my suspicions are
wrong, which <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>I think is not likely, that roving son of mine has
managed to fall in love; and I warn you, Mr. Wynn, especially if
you desire your sister to become your little housekeeper, to take
care of her.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t do so, his siege on her
heart&rsquo;s citadel will prove, I fear, successful.&nbsp; Well,
I forgive him for making love without his father&rsquo;s
permission; and you, Mr. Wynn, must pardon him too.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Wynn, in view of our new arrangements, what
alterations would you propose in the conduct of the business,
bearing this in mind, that you will have to undertake the
purchase of all goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, Mr. Roberts, I recommend your appointing
Mr. Williams to the office I now fill.&nbsp; He is a relative of
yours, and is a thoroughly competent man.&nbsp; Then Mr. Sykes
would succeed McLiver.&nbsp; His honesty and integrity are beyond
question.&nbsp; Had it not been for their able assistance, I
should never have succeeded in unravelling the mysteries of your
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>&ldquo;Your proposal, Mr. Wynn, does infinite credit to
your sagacity.&nbsp; Let the arrangements be carried out at
once.&nbsp; The deed of partnership has already been prepared,
and now awaits your signature.&nbsp; My son signed it before he
left on his recent tour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the new management, the company of Roberts, Wynn &amp;
Roberts, grew mightily.&nbsp; From one end of the kingdom to the
other their teas were in great repute.&nbsp; They had for their
patrons royal princes and the nobles of the land.&nbsp; The
demand grew year after year, and the increased sale brought large
additional profits.&nbsp; During the fifth year of the
partnership, these profits amounted to &pound;45,000, though Mr.
Wynn did not take above &pound;750, one half of which he sent his
aunt and sister for their use.&nbsp; Cadwgan had during those
five years put by &pound;55,000.</p>
<h3><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<i>THE LOST INHERITANCE REGAINED</i>.</h3>
<p>The day previous to the return of Mr. Wynn and young Roberts
to town, they went out alone for a stroll.&nbsp; They took the
road leading to Pont Aberglaslyn, and as both gentlemen were
excellent pedestrians, they soon arrived at that exquisitely
beautiful glen.&nbsp; When on the bridge, they gazed in silence
for some minutes on the dark mad water beneath.&nbsp; After some
minutes&rsquo; silence, Mr. Wynn asked his friend if he had
previously visited the glen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have been here once, Cadwgan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a charming
spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my judgment, Cadwgan, this is the grandest scene in
all Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you prefer it to Bettws-y-Coed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&nbsp; This place has a charm for me which that
sylvan vale has not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it has for me, my friend.&nbsp; <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>The
meandering river flowing down this valley, the high hills on
either side of the glen, the stupendous and overhanging rocks,
with a thousand different colours, foliage, trees, shrubs, and
mosses, with grand old Snowdon in the distance: these, and early
recollections and associations, have rendered this place dearer
to me than all other scenes in my dear native land.&nbsp; I am
glad that our views of this delectable valley are identical,
though I cannot convey to you the depth of my emotion in
contemplating the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cadwgan,&rdquo; replied Mr. Roberts, &ldquo;the spot on
which I now stand is as dear to me as my life.&nbsp; You have
been my adviser, my counsellor, my friend&mdash;ay, more than a
brother to me.&nbsp; Oh, advise me how to act!&nbsp; I confessed
here to your sister my love, and offered her my hand and
heart.&nbsp; I asked her to become mine; but oh, Cadwgan, she
rejected my offer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she, that is, my sister, give any reason for
declining your offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed she did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you she was engaged already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay; she told me she was free.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&ldquo;Did you ask her for an immediate
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she could not be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she gave you no other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Cadwgan; but was not that enough?&nbsp; Since
then I&rsquo;ve been the most miserable of men.&nbsp; Oh, you
must dissuade her from acting towards me so cruelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, Roberts, my sister acted as she did, though
I deeply regret the pain her refusal has occasioned you.&nbsp; I
blame you for confessing your love, though I do not blame you for
feeling admiration for my dear sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it, Cadwgan, you are not favourable to my
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far from being unfavourable, my dear Roberts, I will
confess to you that I know of no one whom I should so like to
have for a brother as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are willing for me to renew my suit
hereafter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;But you have expressed your approval of your
sister&rsquo;s rejection of my suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; Pray explain
yourself, my dear Cadwgan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do so in a few words.&nbsp; Before I can
permit my dear sister to entertain your proposal, your father
must be fully informed of your intention.&nbsp; His views of such
an alliance might be very different from yours.&nbsp; He might
wish you to marry the daughter of a wealthy city merchant,
therefore he would regard your proposal as foolish and
imprudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cadwgan, you do my dear father great injustice.&nbsp;
He has an abundance of wealth.&nbsp; He would be the last man to
make my marriage a matter of money speculation.&nbsp; I know
better than you can his feelings, and am sure that, in a matter
so momentous, his first consideration would be my
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt but such are your father&rsquo;s
feelings; still, as I am but a clerk in his establishment, I
can&rsquo;t permit you to address my sister until his consent is
given fully and freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;Well, knowing your high character and scruples,
I must tell you that I have taken steps in order to anticipate
your objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you have not written Mr. Roberts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have, Cadwgan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry; you really should have
waited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, I couldn&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your father replied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; his answer came this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he has ordered your immediate return
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m to stay another week if I
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, has he given you his consent for you to propose
to my dear sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have his hearty approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my sister was not aware of this when you offered
her your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s letter came this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you informed her of your father&rsquo;s feeling in
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I delayed doing so until I spoke to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you have kept the information
from Gwenfan.&nbsp; But she must not be kept in ignorance longer
than can be helped; and since you have opened your mind freely to
me, I may as well tell you that at the proper time and after I
have consulted your father, she is prepared to accept your
hand.&nbsp; As her brother and guardian, I will then, my dear
Roberts, give her to you.&nbsp; I know you will watch over her
with the deepest affection and solicitude.&nbsp; In this matter I
have only one request to make, which I am sure will be readily
granted.&nbsp; Will you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, dear friend, you will is law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My request is a simple one, namely, that your marriage
be deferred for a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too cruel to defer the day of my being made
perfectly happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for your and her sake I think there should be
reasonable delay.&nbsp; It is true your father is a rich man, but
for the present you are simply a son of a city prince.&nbsp;
Possibly he might give you &pound;1000 a year, but I should like
to see you in business yourself before you settle <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>down.&nbsp;
Then my dear sister is young: only little over eighteen
years.&nbsp; Three or four years is not long to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present I will not argue the point with you,
you will learn that I am not in the position you fancy I
am.&nbsp; I cannot explain myself further now, but when we return
to town, you, dear Cadwgan, will know all.&nbsp; Others will
reveal facts to you which I am bound to keep secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we&rsquo;ll talk on this matter
again.&nbsp; We must now return to the Villa, and make our
arrangements for our immediate return to London.&nbsp; Early
to-morrow morning we must leave, otherwise we shall arrive at the
warehouse on the day our leave expires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the evening, Mr. Roberts and Gwenfan had a long
conversation.&nbsp; When he returned to the library to join
Cadwgan, he whispered, &ldquo;It is all settled; I&rsquo;m now
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following August, Miss Wynn and her aunt paid a long
visit to London.&nbsp; During their stay, they were frequent
visitors at Mr. Roberts&rsquo; urban mansion.&nbsp; The more he
saw of <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>the gentle, quiet, and lovely Gwenfan, the more he
liked her; and when the time came when those loving hearts were
to be made one, he took his son&rsquo;s and future
daughter&rsquo;s hands in his, saying, &ldquo;Be true to each
other; and you, my son, guard this beautiful Cambrian plant, for
I am persuaded she is worth her weight in gold.&nbsp; You, Rhys,
have made a wise choice, I would rather have Gwenfan for my
daughter than a princess of the royal blood.&nbsp; May Heaven
bless your union!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now pass over a brief period of history.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts
had now ceased to be a partner in the firm.&nbsp; From the date
of Mr. Wynn joining the firm until Mr. Roberts&rsquo; retirement,
the house had prospered year after year.&nbsp; The partners
became wealthy men, were of high repute in the city, and Mr.
Wynn, who was considered the soul of the business, was looked up
to as a man almost unequalled for business talents, while his
word was regarded as law by all with whom he had any mercantile
transactions.</p>
<p>Of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; intended retirement, Mr. <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Wynn knew
nothing until the very morning it was carried out.&nbsp; When
they met in the former&rsquo;s private office, he
asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many years, Mr. Wynn, has our partnership
lasted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five years, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years to-day, sir, I entered your
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how rapidly the time passes!&nbsp; Well I have to
thank my heavenly Father for having directed your footsteps
here.&nbsp; You have proved yourself a faithful friend, since the
date of our partnership.&nbsp; By your tact, judgment, business
habits, industry, and integrity, you have raised our house to the
highest commercial position.&nbsp; You are almost as dear to me,
Cadwgan, as if you were my own child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wynn, &ldquo;I have
received the greatest kindness and consideration.&nbsp; To me you
have been a second father.&nbsp; No parent could have shown a
deeper interest in a son than you have shown in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;As you are now a rich man, Cadwgan, why
don&rsquo;t you seek a wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you would be a
better and happier man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, Mr. Roberts, anticipated your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it, Cadwgan, though you surprise
me.&nbsp; I was not aware of your having fixed your heart on any
young lady.&nbsp; I hope she is worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From you, sir, I keep nothing.&nbsp; The lady is Miss
Jones; she has accepted my offer, and her parents have given
their consent to our union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear this, for your sake and
hers.&nbsp; Jones is a capital fellow, and his daughter is a
noble girl.&nbsp; She has in her own right a splendid fortune,
and her father must be a rich man.&nbsp; She will make you an
excellent wife.&nbsp; Her fortune is in the funds, and if
necessary you could turn it to immediate account.&nbsp; I hope
you will get back the old place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Wynn, as you have told me your secret, I see
no reason why I should withhold from you mine.&nbsp; I, too, am
about <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>to
contract a marriage; I do not find it good to be alone; I am
going to be wedded to my first love.&nbsp; Strange to say, her
name is Wynn.&nbsp; Do you know any lady in your parts of North
Wales of that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, I don&rsquo;t at present recollect any
lady of the name of Wynn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try, Cadwgan, and remember.&nbsp; My impression is you
must remember; she is acquainted with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Mr. Roberts, you don&rsquo;t refer to my
aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do though.&nbsp; Are you willing to give her to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most willing, sir, as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are pleased at the prospect of a closer
connection between us?&nbsp; You have placed me in possession of
your feeling.&nbsp; Now please give me the reason of its
existence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will do, sir, in a few words.&nbsp; Though she
is my aunt, and the only relative I have in the world, except my
dear sister, I must say that she is one of the kindest and best
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>of
women.&nbsp; I am sure she will make you happy.&nbsp; But, sir, I
did not know you had ever seen my aunt until she came to visit me
in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Wynn was my earliest love.&nbsp; I proposed to
her, but her brother, your dear father, objected to our
union.&nbsp; I left for London immediately afterwards, got
married, settled down in business, but from the day of my
departure until her visit to you we never met.&nbsp; Mr. Jones
was fully aware of the circumstance of my being rejected.&nbsp;
It was, indeed, the fact of my proposal of which Jones took
advantage to plead so persistently for you when he wished you to
come here.&nbsp; Little did I know then what a noble boy you
were, what a treasure I was to have in you.&nbsp; But let that
pass: I have one favour to ask you.&nbsp; Will you grant
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, to the extent of every penny I
possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you consent to be married on the same day as
myself?&nbsp; And we will arrange that Rhys and your sister shall
also be <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>united on the occasion.&nbsp; Next, will you sign that
parchment, without asking any question, or examining its
contents? you can make yourself acquainted with the particulars
hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heartily I say yes, to your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, I thank you from my heart of hearts for
your goodness and confidence.&nbsp; The document contains a
dissolution of partnership so far as I am concerned.&nbsp; You,
and your future brother are now the owners of everything
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Roberts,&rdquo; replied Cadwgan, with tears in his
eyes, &ldquo;how can I ever repay you for so noble and so
generous an act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you have already repaid me with your
grateful tear, by your ten years of faithful services, and by the
splendid gift of your aunt.&nbsp; There is the ledger, which you
can scan at leisure.&nbsp; You will find the facts fully set
forth.&nbsp; Here is a mortgage deed for &pound;50,000,&mdash;a
sum which simply represents your share of the profits of the
business during the period of our partnership.&nbsp; The other
mortgagee is your intended father-in-law, who has invested <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>his
daughter&rsquo;s fortune in the same property as her trustee and
guardian.&nbsp; The two sums amount to &pound;115,000, which are
secured on your paternal estate, Wynn Castle.&nbsp; On the day of
your marriage, the estate, which has been greatly improved since
your poor father&rsquo;s death, will be conveyed to you as sole
owner, by cancelling those deeds.&nbsp; How this matter has been
arranged it is not necessary for you to know.&nbsp; I rejoice
beyond measure in your being about to take possession of your
lost inheritance, and to regain it by means so honourable to
yourself.&nbsp; My prayer shall be that Heaven will bless you
with health and prosperity, and that you may long live to enjoy
it.&nbsp; I have now done my day&rsquo;s work, so for the present
must wish you good morning.&nbsp; We shall soon meet
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But few additional words are necessary to complete this
history.&nbsp; In a few months after the above interview, Mr.
Roberts, Mr. Roberts junior, and Cadwgan were married to the
ladies of their choice.</p>
<p>During a portion of each summer, Mr. and <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>Mrs.
Cadwgan Wynn, and Mr. and Mrs. Roberts, senior and junior spent
several weeks at Wynn Castle, where Mr. and Mrs. Owen Jones had
taken up their permanent abode.&nbsp; The various tenants on the
estate rejoiced in possessing such an excellent landlord, but
their joy was unbounded on the morning the news reached them of
the birth of a son and heir.&nbsp; On the return to the castle
after this event, his tenantry presented him with an address, to
which he replied as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends and neighbours,&mdash;After many years of exile
from the land of my birth and the home of my father&rsquo;s
sepulchre, I feel it my first duty to return my gratitude to Him
who guides and directs the destiny of us all, for having in His
good and merciful providence again directed my footsteps to the
land of my love and my warmest affection.&nbsp; Twelve years to
day I went out in the wide world, poor and almost
penniless.&nbsp; I resolved, with Heaven&rsquo;s help, to
succeed, that is if success could be achieved by honesty,
integrity, and plodding.&nbsp; After wandering about London for
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>several
days, I found myself one summer evening on London Bridge, faint,
anxious, and sick, with but a few shillings in my pocket.&nbsp;
Just as I was about to settle down to sleep on the cold stone, a
good Welsh Samaritan who was passing by had compassion on the
forlorn one, and took me to his home.&nbsp; Strange to say, his
noble daughter fell in love with me, poor and friendless though I
was.&nbsp; That lady is my wife and the mother of my son.&nbsp; I
might tell you that her love for dear old Cambria is as deep and
as intense as is her love for her offspring.&nbsp; Moreover, her
heart is full of sympathy for the sons and daughters of human
suffering wherever found, and she will consider it not only a
pleasure but a duty to visit and administer consolation and
solace to the distressed in this beautiful valley.&nbsp; But,
says my friend on my right, you must not remain idle; you have
work to do.&nbsp; My dear friend, the Rev. Thomas Charles, who is
an honour to our country, is doing much for the intellectual,
moral, and religious welfare of the people.&nbsp; You ought to
support <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>his efforts by every means in your power.&nbsp; Him I
will aid with my purse and influence.&nbsp; I hope in this effort
we shall be united, conformists and nonconformists, joining hand
in hand and heart with heart, so that our people may become an
intelligent and religious people.&nbsp; To bring about such a
glorious consummation is the chief desire of my soul.&nbsp; I
have only one more word to add, that is to thank you for your
beautiful address.&nbsp; Be assured that I and my wife will
endeavour to earn your good opinion.&nbsp; We will try to promote
your commercial welfare, and with it your highest
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>McLiver in due time was brought before the bar of justice, and
his guilt having been clearly established, was banished the
kingdom.&nbsp; After undergoing ten years of punishment in Van
Diemen&rsquo;s Land, he obtained his release, and settled down in
one of the Australian colonies as a small farmer.&nbsp; His uncle
and cousin were finally apprehended, and being found guilty were
transported.&nbsp; <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<i>TRADITIONS OF GIRALDUS</i>.</h3>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not
a tree,<br />
A llyn, a leaf, a blossom, but contains<br />
A folio volume.&nbsp; We may read, and read,<br />
And read again, and still find something new.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respecting Llyn Savathan, which also bears the several names
of Lake Brecheinoc, Brecinaumere, Llangorse, and Talyllyn Pool,
Giraldus relates that in the reign of Henry I., Gruffydd, son of
Rhys ap Theodor, held under the king one comot, namely, the
fourth part of the cantref of Caoc, in the cantref Mawr.&nbsp;
When Gruffydd, on his return from the king&rsquo;s court, passed
near this lake, which at this cold season of the year was covered
with wild fowl of <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>various sorts, being accompanied by Milo, Earl of
Hereford and Lord of Brecon, and Payn FitzJohn, Lord of Ewyas,
who at that time were secretaries and privy counsellors to the
King, Earl Milo, wishing to draw from Gruffydd some discourse
concerning his innate nobility, rather jocularly than seriously
thus addressed him: &ldquo;It is an ancient saying in Wales, that
if the natural prince of the country, coming to this lake, shall
order the birds to sing, they will immediately obey
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which Gruffydd replied, &ldquo;Do you,
therefore, who now hold the dominion of this land, first give the
command.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he and Payn, having in vain commanded,
and Gruffydd perceiving that it was necessary for him to do so in
his turn, dismounted from his horse, and falling on his knees
towards the east, as if he had been about to engage in battle,
prostrate on the ground, with his eyes and hands uplifted to
heaven, poured forth devout prayers to the Lord; and at length
rising up, and signing his face and forehead with the figure of
the cross, thus openly spake, &ldquo;Almighty God, and Lord Jesus
Christ, who <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>knowest all things, declare here, this day, Thy
power.&nbsp; If Thou hast caused me to descend lineally from the
natural princes of Cambria, I command these birds, in Thy name,
to declare it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And immediately, beating the waters
with their wings, the birds began to cry aloud and proclaim
him.&nbsp; The spectators were astonished and confounded; and
Earl Milo, with FitzJohn, hastily returned to court, and related
this singular occurrence to Henry, who is said to have replied,
&ldquo;By the death of Christ, it is not a matter of so much
wonder; for although by our great authority we commit acts of
violence and wrong against these people, yet they are known to be
the rightful inheritors of this land.&rdquo;</p>

230</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<i>THE LAST WARNING</i>.</h3>
<p>Long previous to the time to which the tradition of Giraldus
relates, the place occupied by Llyn Savathan formed a beautiful
and picturesque valley, through which the waters of the Llewenny
meandered and flowed gently along in their progress towards the
Wye.&nbsp; On the left bank of the Llynfi, and within half a mile
of its channel, there stood the church of Llangasty, which was
dedicated to Saint Gasty, an eminent British saint who flourished
in the fifth century, and was murdered on the Van Mountain, in
the parish of Merthyr Cynog.&nbsp; On the other side of the
Llynfi, and nearly opposite the church, there stood a magnificent
palace, belonging to and occupied by a tyrannical prince, who
neither feared God nor regarded man, who scorned religion, and
loathed everything which was pure and good and beautiful; a
prince who, by the magnitude of his extortions and the <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>relentlessness with which he pursued his unfortunate
vassals, became the object of hate and intense aversion to all
who had dealings or came in contact with him.&nbsp; Moreover, as
he grew older, his extortions became more burdensome, while his
tyranny increased in its fury, notwithstanding the warnings he
received from those who desired the perpetuation of his
reign.&nbsp; To all those warnings he turned a deaf ear, while he
punished with the utmost rigour those who sought to thwart him in
his infamous practices.</p>
<p>It was a cold December morning, when Father Olyver, of
Llangasty, repaired to the palace in order to condole with the
prince on the death of a son.&nbsp; On entering the
reception-room, and finding the prince alone, he thus addressed
him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart grieves and is sad, my prince, at the loss you
have sustained.&nbsp; Another prop of your house has been taken
away, and oh, reflect, I pray, on your present mode of life;
consider your ways and be wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cease thy babbling, Father Olyver,&rdquo; replied <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>the
prince.&nbsp; &ldquo; D&mdash; it, man, all must die.&nbsp; The
death of another son, thou senseless priest, only diminishes my
responsibility as a father, and now I shall have more to leave to
the survivors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t speak thus, my lord, of your
child.&nbsp; The fruit of your loins should ever be regarded with
affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved the boy when living, Father Olyver.&nbsp; But
now, man, he has ceased to live; the spirit, the soul, has gone;
a clod of earth only remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so, my lord.&nbsp; Yet I must own that I look on
his untimely end as a terrible warning to you.&nbsp; The event
tells you to set your house in order, for in such an hour as ye
think not the Son of man cometh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Father Olyver.&nbsp; I suppose, when He
comes, I must go like the rest, in spite of the saints and mother
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you prepared, my prince, when the voice
calls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am, father.&nbsp; Let his majesty come
whenever he pleases, I&rsquo;ll accompany him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;Are you ready, my dear prince, to appear,
without fear, before your God when He calls you hence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are beautiful maidens, too, father, before whom I
must and delight to appear, after my evening&rsquo;s
carousals!&nbsp; Ah! ah! ah!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be bound that even
you, Father Olyver, with your sanctimonious jib, are not
indifferent to the smiles of a pretty wench, and you won&rsquo;t
turn away when you happen to have a glimpse of a fine
ankle.&nbsp; Human nature is human nature all the world
over.&nbsp; I warrant priests of mother Church don&rsquo;t always
keep it in subjection.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the time, nor is it a fitting occasion, my
lord, to indulge in such language,&rdquo; replied the
priest.&nbsp; &ldquo;For one day, at least, especially in the
presence of the dead, I beseech you to cease speaking
thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I, man, refrain from telling the truth even
now?&nbsp; Bedad, I&rsquo;ve hit the right nail on the head this
time at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present, however, I shall regard your charge of
me and my orders in silence.&nbsp; I have come here to perform
the last rites of <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>the Church over the dead.&nbsp; The day to me is one of
unusual solemnity.&nbsp; I loved your son as if he had been my
own child.&nbsp; He was a good and pious youth, notwithstanding
the evil influences by which he was surrounded.&nbsp; But he is
gone, and the place that knew him shall know him no more.&nbsp;
And now, my lord, what hour have you fixed for carrying his
remains to that silent bourne from whence no traveller ever comes
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We propose to bury at five; and after the funeral I
have, Father Olyver, a grand banquet in my palace, and we
anticipate a merry meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And cannot you, my lord, give up folly and pleasure for
a single day?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you devote one evening to
pursuits which harmonize with the solemnity of the day?&nbsp; You
have received from time to time, and year after year, the most
terrible warnings, yet you heed them not.&nbsp; You hear the
sound of the trumpet, to which you have paid no attention.&nbsp;
If you continue to live as you have lived, my dear
prince&mdash;if you resolve, come what will, <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>to steel
your heart, and defy the Almighty,&mdash;the day is not far
distant when the wrath of an angry God will descend upon you and
yours, and on that day&mdash;rather on that dark and dismal
night&mdash;the sword of His justice will descend, and the
innocent and the guilty shall perish together.&nbsp; I now leave
you, my prince, but in a few hours we shall meet again at the
grave of departed virtue, and something tells me that when we
then part it will be a parting for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time appointed the funeral cort&egrave;ge arrived at
Llangasty.&nbsp; The young prince was buried with extraordinary
pomp.&nbsp; When the service was concluded, Father Olyver went up
and pressed the hand of the prince, and bidding him good-bye,
whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Remember, my lord, the warning
voice: it has spoken once, twice, ay, thrice; the next time it
will speak in thunder and lightning, when the earth shall move
and reel like a drunken man.&nbsp; So now, farewell.&nbsp; I fear
we shall never meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good priest then turned away from <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>prince and
people.&nbsp; He re-entered the church for evening song, while
the prince and the mourners returned to the palace to make merry
and be glad.&nbsp; Before they arrived home, the day had
disappeared, and the night had come.&nbsp; Darkness had settled
down upon the earth.&nbsp; When they entered the palace, they
little dreamt of being on the very brink of a precipice over
which they would be hurled by the fiat of the Eternal.</p>

237</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<i>THE FATAL BANQUET</i>; <i>OR</i>, <i>VENGEANCE AT
HAND</i>.</h3>
<p>The palace of the Prince of Llynfi was characterized by
drunkenness and vice, dissipation and sensuality, intemperance
and debauchery.&nbsp; Virtue had no lodgment there.&nbsp;
Righteousness had no habitation there.&nbsp; Justice, religion,
and truth were wholly absent from the palace of the prince.&nbsp;
He and his family gave themselves up to pleasure, to riotous
living, and to revellings; and from day to day, week to week, and
month to month, they lived as if there was no God&mdash;no
hereafter&mdash;no judgment to come!&nbsp; Moreover, they had so
sunk in sin and iniquity, that they were quite insensible to
those feelings which are common and general, and indeed
universal, in the lowest state of humanity.&nbsp; Flower after
flower of the family circle had withered and died, or had been
plucked from the tree of life by the will of the Almighty, yet
from the heart of the <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>survivors there never escaped a
sigh; never a tear was shed; their hearts had become a flinty
rock, and were as insensible of impression as the Parian
marble.&nbsp; Thus they lived: thus, too, they died; for at last
they were cut down as cumberers of the ground.</p>
<p>Before the untimely death of the son, the prince had arranged
for a grand banquet to take place on the very day his mortal
remains were consigned to the tomb.&nbsp; During the progress of
preparation for the funeral, preparations were also being made
for the expected banquet.&nbsp; On their return from the church,
many of the guests had already arrived and many more soon
followed.&nbsp; By nine o&rsquo;clock the palace was filled with
a splendid array of the licentious male and female inhabitants of
the villages in the surrounding country.&nbsp; According to old
traditions, two renowned minstrels from a distance had been
summoned to cheer them in their revels; and riot and disorder,
such as had never before been witnessed even in that palace,
resounded among the hills.&nbsp; The party had been many hours
assembled: it <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>was midnight.&nbsp; In the midst of their revellings
there was suddenly heard a crash of thunder, which shook the
palace to its foundation; and this was immediately followed by
louder and louder peals, which boomed through the valley as the
noise of a thousand pieces of artillery.&nbsp; The prince and his
riotous companions were awe-struck, and presently they heard a
voice saying in deep, solemn tones, &ldquo;Vengeance is at
hand!&rdquo;&nbsp; In a moment the two minstrels arose, and
beholding in the air a mysterious hand beckoning to them, they
fled after it as it retreated.&nbsp; The hand moved faster and
faster, and as it moved they increased their speed.&nbsp; After
they had gone a considerable distance the earth heaved violently,
and appeared to totter on its foundations.&nbsp; For a moment
they turned round to see the distance they had come.&nbsp; They
saw the ground divide in twain, and up through this large chasm
they beheld the waters rushing forth like the ocean when
convulsed, and mingling with the roaring sound of the waters were
the dying shrieks of the revellers.&nbsp; Pausing for another
moment in their <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>flight, the minstrels observed, with great terror, a
wide expanse of boiling and agitated waters where the palace and
village had stood, engulfing the palace and its wicked and
impious inmates far below its bosom.&nbsp; Since then, Llyn
Savathan has ever been regarded as an unhallowed spot; the great
wickedness of the prince and his followers having drawn upon them
the just judgment of the Eternal.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When but a mere youth, I had a strong and extreme longing to
visit Holywell, or Treffynnon, which according to my youthful
fancy was the most wonderful place under the sun.&nbsp; This
desire had its origin in the following circumstances.</p>
<p>About three miles from my paternal abode there was situate a
small village, which had risen into fame and notoriety by reason
of its annual May fair.&nbsp; At this fair an immense number of
people congregated.&nbsp; Young men and maidens <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>were
there.&nbsp; Farmers&rsquo; sons and daughters flocked in great
numbers; and this being the annual hiring fair, hundreds of men
and women servants went to find either new masters or fresh
mistresses.&nbsp; Then from the neighbouring towns and villages,
people came for the purpose of providing fun, amusement, and
entertainment for the holiday seekers.&nbsp; Shows innumerable
were there; Mr. Cheap Jack vending his wares, with which he
combined interesting stories and flashes of wit, had thousands of
willing and enchanted listeners, and a goodly number of ready
purchasers.&nbsp; On the roadside from one end of the village to
the other was a continuous row of stalls, laden with every
conceivable variety of articles.&nbsp; All these marvellous
things filled my boyish fancy with amazement and wonder.</p>
<p>But what struck me most, was a person who had a stall situate
near the bridge, on which were placed in rows several thousands
of small wooden boxes, which in circumference were about the size
of a crown piece, and three quarters of an inch deep.&nbsp; These
boxes he <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>arranged with great deliberation and care, and when he
completed his work, not a single box could be seen out of its
proper place.</p>
<p>This person was fantastically dressed.&nbsp; He wore a
three-cornered hat, the brim of which was tipped with gold.&nbsp;
He had pink velvet breeches, with a waistcoat of similar
material; red stockings, and shoes with silver buckles.&nbsp; His
frock coat, made of good West of England broadcloth, had, in
consequence of many years&rsquo; wear, become a dark blood
colour.&nbsp; In his hat were placed two rows of feathers,
arranged in the form of the Prince of Wales&rsquo; plume.&nbsp;
He was certainly a most singular looking figure, and from the
hour when he commenced to expatiate on the virtues of his wares
until the dusk of the evening, attracted an immense audience.</p>
<p>When his preparations were finished, he took in his left hand
one of the little boxes, from which he removed the lid, or cover,
and commenced to address the crowd in the following
fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;This box, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;contains wonderful ointment.&nbsp; It will <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>cure the
itch, the stitch, and nettle-rash.&nbsp; It is a sure remedy for
all diseases of the skin.&nbsp; It will, when applied, remove
warts from the fingers, corns from the toes, and bunions from the
feet.&nbsp; It is an effectual cure for cuts, bruises, and for
every kind of wounds.&nbsp; Time, ladies and gentlemen, would
fail me to speak of its wonderful properties, and the history of
cases it has cured would fill a dozen large volumes.&nbsp; Every
man should therefore possess half a dozen boxes of this valuable
salve.&nbsp; They should be placed in the nobleman&rsquo;s
palace, in every farm house, in every poor man&rsquo;s
cottage.&nbsp; The use of this wonderful ointment will save you
many a long doctor&rsquo;s bill, and, between you and me, doctors
are doing their best to stop its sale, because one box of this
salve is worth a hundred visits of the physician.&nbsp; People
have paid lots of money to doctors without getting any benefit;
they then came to me, and by using one box only, were made
perfectly whole.&nbsp; This ointment is the grandest discovery of
the age.&nbsp; It was found out, not by man&rsquo;s skill, oh,
no; but an angel <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>came from distant worlds and directed my sainted mother
how to make it.&nbsp; The secret is with me, and it must remain
with me; for were it known, its efficacy would disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, ladies and gentlemen, would doubtless like to know
the several constituent parts of this justly renowned ointment,
but as I have already said, I dare not reveal the secret.&nbsp;
The spirit of one who when on this earth was as pure as she was
comely and beautiful, told the secret to my sainted mother.&nbsp;
I refer to Saint Winifred, who was murdered twelve hundred years
ago.&nbsp; From the spot on which she was beheaded, her head
rolled down the declivity, and did not stop until it reached the
altar of the church, and immediately there sprang up a spring of
water, which in volume is unequalled in the world.&nbsp; The
wonderful salve is not called after the saint, this her spirit
forbade, but Eli Treffynnon, or Holywell salve.&nbsp; As I make
it myself, I can offer to sell it at twopence per box, though
doctors charge sixpence for a far inferior article.&nbsp;
Twopence per box being the price, for which I charge no more nor
will I <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>take less.&nbsp; Who will buy? who will buy?&nbsp; Now
is your time, for I shall not visit these parts for twelve
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people then rushed to the vendor of Eli Treffynnon, and in
less than an hour he had disposed of more than a thousand boxes
of the ointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful man that, is he not?&rdquo; said I to my
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Can you tell me where Treffynnon is?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied my companion; &ldquo;but it
is in the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; In the north of England or Scotland,
which?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, in neither; but in North Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Is it a town or a village?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A town, I believe; but it is not a large
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have you ever heard of the remarkable
well before?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen an account of it in an
old book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; If I knew the way, I would go and
see this wonderful fountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.&nbsp; Go two hundred miles
to see a spring!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Because you can see plenty of fountains
nearer home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; But this is a well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a well to be sure.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t the
waters of all rivers come from wells?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of course they do.&nbsp; But it requires
a hundred wells to make up the Severn, the Wye, and the Ithon,
but here is a large river from one well, one spring.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll certainly go one of these days and see it.</p>
<p>Many, many years, however, came, and passed away, before the
design I then formed was carried out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>My first visit to Holywell, or Treffynnon, took place just
about the close of the Crimean War.&nbsp; I arrived in the town
late one evening in mid winter, but as the night was extremely
dark, while the rain descended in torrents, I refrained <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>from
leaving my hotel, the name of which I do not at present
remember.&nbsp; It was then the principal inn of the town, with a
first rate bill of fare.</p>
<p>Being a private gentleman, and therefore debarred from joining
the commercials, breakfast was prepared for me in a snug little
parlour which was generally used by the landlady as her private
sitting-room.&nbsp; Before I had taken my seat at the breakfast,
the waitress came into the room, all smiles, and asked me if I
had any objection to a gentleman joining me at the morning
meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the gentleman?&rdquo; I asked the waitress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Squire Eli, of Ffynnon Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What kind of a person is he?&nbsp; Is he
old or young, has he a hump on his back, and does he wear
spectacles? is he a nice, good-tempered fellow, or sour as crab
beer?&nbsp; Tell me, gentle maid, the kind of companion I am to
be honoured with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, how you do talk.&nbsp; Squire is a nice,
well-spoken gentleman; and I am sure you&rsquo;ll like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Show the gentleman up; but tell
your mistress that she will be a loser by his introduction,
because I generally eat twice as much in company as when
alone.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. Eli made his appearance, and I expressed to him
how greatly pleased I was at his honouring me with his
presence.</p>
<p>He replied to my remarks in a very neat speech, and said he
was delighted in the opportunity of making my acquaintance,
having heard of me from a common friend.</p>
<p>Before rising from the table I said, &ldquo;What a beautiful
name you have selected for your seat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do you know Welsh?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I know a little; I wish I knew
more.&nbsp; It is the grandest language under the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For expressiveness and eloquence and poetry, you are
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I presume you selected the name because
you have a crystal fountain by the Hall?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no.&nbsp; There is a fountain it is true, but
its existence in no way determined me to select the name; and,
between us, I don&rsquo;t think <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>there is a similar designation for a
house in North or South Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have you visited the south, Mr. Eli?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visited the South!&nbsp; Why, there is not a town or
village in the six counties I&rsquo;ve not been in.&nbsp; I know
the country well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been at Bridgend, in the county of
R.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Bridgend!&nbsp; Of course I have; many and many a
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, I have seen
you there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably you have; that is, if you ever attended its
annual May fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Then you are the man, the veritable
vendor of Eli Treffynnon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&nbsp; I thought the waitress had duly
informed you of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; No, no; but never mind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
delighted to see you.&nbsp; Your speech on your ointment awoke in
my bosom an intense longing to see this place; and I&rsquo;ve
come almost specially to see for myself its wonders.&nbsp; I
hope, therefore, <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>Mr. Eli, you have no special engagement this
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose I have not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; In that case I trust you will be my
cicerone.&nbsp; I am extremely anxious to know the history and
traditions of the wonderful well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accompany you with pleasure, and tell its
wondrous history.&nbsp; When shall we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Now, if you please.</p>
<p>Just as we reached the lower part of the principal street, we
saw a man with measured steps approaching us.&nbsp; The man had a
leathern strap fastened round his neck, at the other end of which
was suspended a large bell, a cushion being buckled to the right
knee.&nbsp; Every time the cushioned knee came forward the bell
jingled, and it being of considerable size its tones could be
heard a long distance from the scene of the man&rsquo;s
perambulations.&nbsp; When he came up to the place where we were
standing, I asked Mr. Eli the question,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that man mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means: he is in his right mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; No sane man, I should think, would
be guilty of such folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eli, &ldquo;is doing a
Christian duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I fail to see any act of devotion in
carrying a bell about the town.&nbsp; Please, Mr. Eli, explain
yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, a stranger, very naturally conclude the man is
demented.&nbsp; When you know the object of his mission you will
come to a different opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Pray, Mr. Eli, enlighten me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a church here, my dear sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That church is situate in a hole at the head of a deep
dell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; But what has that to do with this
man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eli; &ldquo;we cannot, up the
town, hear the church chimes, though we are not two hundred yards
from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; But the man does not carry your church
bells on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, no; but this man walks round <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the town
just before divine service, and the ringing of his bell warns the
people that it is time for them to go to church.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; A singular invention, certainly.&nbsp;
Pity they built the church in such an outlandish place.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Eli</i>.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t say so.&nbsp; The church
was built there by direction.&nbsp; It is close to the well of
St. Winifred, the healing waters of which, as you are aware, are
celebrated far and near.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Then the tales you and others tell about
the efficacy of the waters of the fountain are really true?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, they are perfectly true.&nbsp; When all
is said and written about the waters, we can truly say that the
half is not told.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I should like to possess a true and
authentic history of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eli, &ldquo;you
would.&nbsp; Its history has yet to be written.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; There is, then, evidence, Mr. Eli, that
people who have bathed in its waters have been made whole?</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;Yes; plenty of evidence,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eli;
&ldquo;and if you will now accompany me to the well, I&rsquo;ll
show you some of the many witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we entered the building, my friend conducted me to a spot
where we had a good view of the interior.&nbsp; He pointed with
his finger to the roof, at the same time remarking, &ldquo;Up
there, look up there, for there is the evidence, the witnesses,
to which I referred.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Do you mean those barrows, hand carts,
crutches, and staves, and other things too numerous to mention,
fastened to the ceiling?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&nbsp; Are they not irresistible
witnesses to the healing power of these waters?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I really fail to see your point, Mr.
Eli.&nbsp; Pray explain yourself more fully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People come here,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;from
all parts of the world.&nbsp; Some come on wheel-barrows, some on
crutches, some by the aid of walking-sticks; they bathe in these
healing waters, like they did when our Lord was upon earth, and
are cleansed.&nbsp; They leave here new men and women, and having
no further need of either crutch or barrow, leave them behind <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>as
witnesses to the power of this wonderful fountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have greatly excited my curiosity,
Mr. Eli.&nbsp; Pray furnish me with some information respecting
the history of this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are heartily welcome to the facts and traditions I
have been fortunate enough to succeed in collecting, which can be
briefly told.&nbsp; They are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, that is, about twelve hundred and
twenty-five years ago, this Treffynnon was a royal city, and then
the king&rsquo;s palace was within its precincts.&nbsp; The then
reigning sovereign was Allen the First, and his dominion extended
over the whole of the hundred of Coleshill, from the royal mines
of which he derived a princely income.&nbsp; The king had a son
of the name of Cradocus, a name which has led old writers to
conclude that his mother was a daughter of some Roman, who,
preferring this country to his own, and having espoused a British
lady, settled down here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time of which I speak, there resided in Holywell
a potent lord of the Trewith, who <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>married Lady Wento, an only sister
of Saint Beuno, descendants of an ancient and illustrious
Montgomeryshire family.&nbsp; The only issue of this marriage was
a daughter, a beautiful and lovely maiden, who was as pure as she
was beautiful, whose name was Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she had grown up to be a young lady, her uncle,
Saint Beuno, who resided at Clynnog, in Carnarvonshire, came on
one occasion to this royal town to pay a friendly visit to his
family.&nbsp; During his stay he obtained a grant of land from
Lord Trewith, his brother-in-law, upon which he erected a
church.&nbsp; Now the altar of that church was close by yon
bubbling fountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have you historical proofs of this, Mr.
Eli? I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see by-and-by the evidence upon which I
rely.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Pray proceed; your narrative is deeply
interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the erection of the church,&rdquo; Mr. Eli
continued, &ldquo;Saint Beuno took under his charge his niece
Winifred, who vowed to remain a <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>virgin, and to devote her life to
works of charity, mercy, and religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a lovely Sunday evening, on the 22nd of June, the
Lady Winifred left her parents&rsquo; castle for the purpose of
taking a walk in the cool of the day.&nbsp; When she attained the
summit of the hill her progress was stayed by Prince Cradocus,
who, being struck with her extreme beauty, at once made a
proposal of marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; replied Lady Winifred, &lsquo;I
can form no earthly ties.&nbsp; I have already vowed my life and
wealth to the work of my Saviour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, noble and beautiful lady, I have sworn you
shall be mine, and nothing shall prevent the fulfilment of my
oath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your offer, illustrious prince, comes too late;
my vow is irrevocable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pray, Lady Winifred, don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp;
Your hand I am resolved to possess, and you shall share with me
the throne of my ancestors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For earthly thrones, prince, I care not; my
treasures are not here but above.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you persist, noble lady, in your refusal, I
am resolved to effect my object by force.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;You dare not do that, prince.&nbsp; You
must not further molest me.&nbsp; Stand by, for I would proceed
on my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cradocus was vexed at being thus robbed of his prey,
and getting into a fearful passion, took his sword from its
sheath, and there and then,&mdash;oh, horror of horrors! cut off
the head of the virgin.&nbsp; For his guilty act, vengeance from
on high soon overtook him.&nbsp; On the spot where he committed
the crime, he fell down a dead man, and the earth opening,
swallowed his impious corpse. <a name="citation260"></a><a
href="#footnote260" class="citation">[260]</a>&nbsp; There is,
however, a tradition, that Cradocus&rsquo;s master, the devil,
carried off his body to the dismal regions of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now about the well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you, that it
was on the hillside above here where Cradocus committed the foul
deed.&nbsp; It appears that when the head was severed from the
body it commenced to roll down the steep hill by which we
descended, and stopped when it reached the altar, before which a
number of devout people were kneeling.&nbsp; The very moment the
head stopped there came up this fountain, the waters <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>of which
possess the same miraculous power as did those waters of the pool
of Bethesda referred to in the Gospel of St. John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears Saint Beuno was the officiating priest at
the altar when this sad event took place.&nbsp; Recognising the
head as that of his beloved niece, he took it up, and ran with it
to where the mangled body lay, to which he rejoined it.&nbsp; To
the astonishment of all present, the head at once united itself
to the body, the place of separation being only marked by a white
ring or line, which extended round the neck.&nbsp; From that hour
she was called Saint Winifred, and was always after regarded as a
holy person, a special vessel chosen by Christ to do His
work.&nbsp; After this event she lived fifteen years, and gained
universal fame by her deeds of love and charity.&nbsp; Well,
though more than twelve hundred years have come and gone since
then, this fountain is as powerful to-day as it was then in
healing and in curing diseases.&nbsp; Hundreds, aye, thousands,
have blessed the day on which they bathed in this Iach&acirc;d
Ffynnon&mdash;healing fountain.&nbsp; Now, my story is
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And a most interesting tale it is,
Mr. Eli, for which I thank you very much.&nbsp; There is one more
circumstance I wish to be informed of in order to have a complete
history of the sainted lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what do you refer?&rdquo; asked Mr. Eli.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I presume the lady died here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; she died in her father&rsquo;s
mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; In that case, I presume, her sepulchre is
in your churchyard?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, my friend,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eli.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Then she was not buried here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she was not interred here, and for this
reason.&nbsp; Her uncle, Saint Beuno, died on the 21st of April,
660, and his remains were interred in the Abbey Church of Bardsey
Island.&nbsp; On his death, Saint Winifred retired to Gwytheriu,
and placed herself under the protection of St. Elerius, who at
that time was living in devotional seclusion in that sequestered
mountain village.&nbsp; At that time there was there a convent of
nuns under the superintendence of Theonia.&nbsp; Saint Winifred
assumed the veil, and on the death of Theonia became the
abbess.&nbsp; On her death, <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>the remains were removed from
Treffynnon to Gwytheriu, and interred near the graves of St. Cybi
and St. Sannan.&nbsp; After a lapse of five hundred years from
the date of her death, the bones of St. Winifred were removed
with great pomp to the church of St. Peter and St. Paul,
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The wooden chest in which the remains were
preserved is still kept.&nbsp; The translation of the
saint&rsquo;s remains took place in the reign of King
Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity that no monument to her
memory has been erected here.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so, Mr.
Eli?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot share your opinion, my friend.&nbsp; This well
and its wonderful cures are monuments which will live when Parian
marble shall crumble into dust.&nbsp; But there is another
monument.&nbsp; Observe,&rdquo; said Mr. Eli, &ldquo;the sweet
scented moss which grows there by the well-side, the
<i>Jungermannia esplenoides</i> of Linn&aelig;us.&nbsp; On each
anniversary of the decollation of Saint Winifred, this moss, and
the stones of the fountain, assume the colour of blood.&nbsp;
This annual change in the tint of the moss is an <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>immortal
monument of the dear departed saint, as if it said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For thee, blest maid, my tears, my endless
pain,<br />
Shall in immortal monuments remain.<br />
The image of thy death each year renew,<br />
And prove my grief, to distant ages, true.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After making a general inspection of the well, and examining
the grotesque figures of animals and other works of sculpture, my
friend and I paid a brief visit to the chapel over the
well.&nbsp; During our stay there, he placed in my hand a copy of
the following letter, addressed by the queen of James II., to Sir
Roger Mostyn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir Roger
Mostyn</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It having pleased the king, by his royal grant, to
bestow upon me the ancient chapel adjoining St. Winifred&rsquo;s
Well, these are to desire you to give present possession, in my
name, of the said chapel, to Mr. Thomas Roberts, who will deliver
this letter into your hands.&nbsp; It being also my intention to
have the place decently repaired, and put to a good use, I
further desire that you will afford him your favour and
protection, that he may not be <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>disturbed in the performance
thereof.&nbsp; You may rest assured that what you do herein,
according to my desire, shall be very kindly remembered by</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your good friend,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mary Regina</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Whitehall</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>May</i> 8<i>th</i>,
1687.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On leaving the chapel, I cordially thanked my friend for the
information he had imparted respecting the Winifred legend; and
told him, that some day I would try to make his name and his Eli
Treffynnon as immortal as the saint whose history he had so
eloquently told.&nbsp; But before my tale sees the light, my
entertainer has gone to that bourne from whence no traveller
returns; yet it may be,&mdash;who knows?&mdash;that his spirit
still visits our world, and communes with dear ones and friends
left behind.</p>

<h2><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>THE
VISIT OF ELIDORUS TO THE FAIRY KINGDOM BENEATH THE BAY.</h2>
<p>A short time before our visit to Swansea, wrote Giraldus
Cambrensis, a circumstance worthy of note occurred in these
parts, which Elidorus, a priest, most strenuously affirmed had
befallen him.&nbsp; When a youth of twelve years, and learning
his letters, since, as Solomon says, &ldquo;The root of learning
is bitter, although the fruit is sweet,&rdquo; in order to avoid
the discipline and frequent stripes inflicted on him by his
preceptor, he ran away, and concealed himself under the hollow
bank of a river.&nbsp; After fasting in that situation for two
days, two little men of pigmy stature appeared to him, saying,
&ldquo;If you will come with us, we will lead you into a country
full of delights and sports.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assenting and rising
up, he followed his guides through a path, at first subterraneous
and dark, into a most beautiful <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>country, adorned with rivers and
meadows, woods and plains, but obscure, and not illuminated with
the full light of the sun.&nbsp; All the days were cloudy, and
the nights extremely dark, on account of the absence of the moon
and stars.&nbsp; The boy was brought before the king, and
introduced to him in the presence of the court; who, having
examined him for a long time, delivered him to his son, who was
then a boy.&nbsp; The men were of the smallest stature, but very
well proportioned in their make; they were all of a fair
complexion, with luxuriant hair falling over their shoulders like
that of women.&nbsp; They had horses and greyhounds adapted to
their size.&nbsp; They neither ate flesh nor fish, but lived on
milk diet, made up into messes with saffron.&nbsp; They never
took an oath, for they detested nothing so much as lies.&nbsp; As
often as they returned from our upper hemisphere, they reprobated
our ambition, infidelities, and inconstancies.&nbsp; They had no
form of public worship, being strict lovers and reverers, as it
seemed, of truth.</p>
<p>The boy frequently returned to our <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>hemisphere, sometimes by the way he
had first gone, sometimes by another; at first in company with
other persons, and afterwards alone; and made himself known only
to his mother, declaring to her the manners, nature, and state of
that people.&nbsp; Being desired by her to bring a present of
gold, with which that region abounded, he stole, when at play
with the king&rsquo;s son, the golden ball with which he used to
divert himself, and brought it to his mother in great haste; and
when he reached the door of his father&rsquo;s house, but not
unpursued, and was entering it in a great hurry, his foot
stumbled on the threshold, and falling down into the room where
his mother was sitting, the two pigmies seized the ball, which
had dropped from his hand, and departed, showing the boy every
mark of contempt and derision.&nbsp; On recovering from the fall,
confounded with shame, and execrating the evil counsel of his
mother, he returned by the usual track to the subterraneous road,
but found no appearance of any passage, though he searched for it
on the banks of the <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>river (Tawe) for nearly the space of
a year.&nbsp; But since those calamities which reason cannot
mitigate are often alleviated by time, and length of time alone
blunts the edge of our afflictions, and puts an end to many
evils, the youth having been brought back by his friends and
mother, and restored to his right way of thinking, and to his
learning, in process of time attained the rank of
priesthood.&nbsp; Whenever David II., Bishop of St.
David&rsquo;s, talked to him in his advanced state of life
concerning this event, he could never relate the particulars
without shedding tears.&nbsp; He had made himself acquainted with
the language of that nation, the words of which, in his younger
days, he used to recite, which, as the bishop had often informed
me, were very conformable to the Greek idiom.&nbsp; When they
asked for water, they said, &ldquo;Ydor ydorum,&rdquo; which
meant, bring water; for &ldquo;ydor,&rdquo; in their language,
signifies water, and dwr also, in the British language, signifies
water.&nbsp; When they wanted salt they said, &ldquo;Halgein
ydorum,&rdquo; bring salt.&nbsp; Salt is called halen in
British.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>[So
far the narrative of Giraldus Cambrensis.&nbsp; We are happy to
be able to lay before our readers some further details, hitherto
unpublished, of the early life of Elidorus, and of his visits to
the fairy kingdom beneath the bay.]</p>
<p>On the brow of Town Hill, and commanding a magnificent view of
Swansea Bay, the channel, and their circumjacent coast, with the
Devonian range of mountains in the distance; there stood, at the
time of which we write, a small thatched cottage, with mud or
clay walls, which was then occupied by Sh&ocirc;n Gwyllt, his
wife Mary, and their son John, an only child.</p>
<p>Sh&ocirc;n, as had been his father and his grandfather before
him, was a fisherman, which, in those times, was a highly
remunerative business.&nbsp; Fish of all kinds were then
abundant, and they commanded a ready market.&nbsp; In the bay
were shoals of conger, cod, mullet, sole, whiting, and flat-fish;
while, in the season, the fishermen were often fortunate enough
to secure in their nets sea trout and salmon, which, for delicacy
of flavour, were unequalled in the British seas and rivers, the
Tawe <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>excepted.&nbsp; In the Tawe salmon were as plentiful as
the daisy on the verdant mead in early summer.&nbsp; The waters
of that river then, and for several hundred years after, were as
clear as the crystal dewdrops.&nbsp; Now it was on that
delightful, that glossy and pellucid river that Sh&ocirc;n Gwyllt
plied his trade, and the sylvan groves on its banks resounded
with the sound of his rich tenor voice.&nbsp; Sh&ocirc;n loved a
good song, and the echo of his voice in the near and distant
groves had for him a peculiar charm.</p>
<p>We have already observed that Sh&ocirc;n plied his calling on
the Tawe.&nbsp; He had a horror of the sea.&nbsp; Upon its waters
he never ventured.&nbsp; Nothing could induce him to join his
brother fishermen in the bay.&nbsp; Though they often tempted him
by predicting that they would certainly have a splendid haul of
fish, yet the prospect of a rich reward for his labour had no
influence on his mind.&nbsp; To their solicitation he used to
reply, &ldquo;The Tawe has been a good and generous parent to me,
so I shall not forsake the kind and rich old <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Sh&ocirc;n did not forsake
her.&nbsp; Day after day, during the season, he might be seen
with his coracle on his back, wending his way down Mount Pleasant
and across the fields to the Tawe (there were no houses there
then), and thence he fished up the river as far as Morriston,
which at that time consisted of a few clod-built huts.&nbsp; It
was but seldom that he ventured above that village, though
occasionally, and once in a way, he fished up to Ynistawe, but
never went so high up the stream as Penllwch.&nbsp; His aversion
to Penllwch appears to have arisen from the circumstance that his
cousin met with an untimely end there, and Sh&ocirc;n dreaded to
fish the deep pools under Glais, where the young man, whom he
loved as a brother, was drowned.</p>
<p>Although Sh&ocirc;n was passionately fond of his trade, yet,
strange to say, he was strongly opposed to his son following in
his footsteps.&nbsp; He reasoned thus: It is an occupation in
which there is a great risk of life.&nbsp; The fisherman has to
contend with bad seasons, and occasionally fish is a drug in the
market.&nbsp; The business is <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>not respectable; those engaged in it
are men of the lowest class, ignorant, drunken, and improvident,
living from hand to mouth, never saving a penny against a rainy
day.&nbsp; Instead of allowing young John to accompany him, he
resolved to send him to school; and to school accordingly his son
was duly sent.&nbsp; John, however, hated school, and intensely
disliked his preceptor, a dislike he gloried in exhibiting
whenever an opportunity offered itself.&nbsp; The teacher
resented the boy&rsquo;s conduct by the free use of the
cane.&nbsp; In the severity of punishment he had no mercy, and to
escape chastisement young Gwyllt often absented himself from
school.&nbsp; The hours thus spent were among the happiest of his
boyhood.&nbsp; After his father had gone, John would walk down to
the Tawe, and leaping into a stranded coracle, he, with his
paddle, would spend hour after hour in skimming over the
waters.&nbsp; When he got tired, he would row to the bank, and
fastening his little boat to the stake, lie down to rest.&nbsp;
The remainder of the youth&rsquo;s story we shall tell in his own
words, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>I lay
me down on the banks of Tawe&rsquo;s crystal waters, and
slept.&nbsp; In my sleep, behold I had a dream.&nbsp; In my dream
or vision I saw a man approaching who was exceeding small in
stature.&nbsp; He was clad in rich apparel, and the fastenings of
his garments&mdash;which were as white as the winter&rsquo;s
snow&mdash;were of pure gold, rubies, and other precious
gems.&nbsp; When he came up to the place where I lay, he
addressed me in the softest and sweetest voice I had ever heard,
and the voice said, &ldquo;Oh, youth with ruddy cheeks and curly
locks, why sleepest thou, seeing it is only the third hour after
the sun of thy world has passed his meridian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sleep,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;to forget the past,
to drown the very thought of existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With youth,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;there is
nothing to regret.&nbsp; The days of youth are days of innocence
and pleasure.&nbsp; Every breeze fans the flame of
delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my sorrow, sweet voice, does not spring from the
heart&rsquo;s passion or paternal unkindness, but from stripes
inflicted upon my <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>body by a tyrannical and cruel teacher, a man who has
no mercy nor kindness of heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks you neglect your lesson,&rdquo; said the
voice, &ldquo;and your preceptor uses the rod in order to teach
you to be wise and learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be so, I&rsquo;d rather be ignorant with whole
bones, than learned with the lash so frequently used on my
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a saying in your country, is there not?&rdquo;
said the voice, &ldquo;&lsquo;spare the rod; spoil the
child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; there is such a proverb, though I believe in
it not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you then believe in, my child?&rdquo; asked the
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in gentleness and kindness.&nbsp; The victory
that overcometh the world is love.&nbsp; Love will soften the
hardest heart, subdue the most stubborn will, and melt the
hardest natures like wax is melted in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you worked hard at your books, and were attentive to
your lessons, your master would probably be kind to you.&nbsp;
You should remember that youth is the time to acquire <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>knowledge,
and that its possession is one of the most pleasurable things on
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowledge might be all you say in its favour, sweet
voice, but I care not for it.&nbsp; One day spent on the banks of
this beautiful river, or skimming on the bosom of its limpid and
crystal waters in some friend&rsquo;s coracle, from which I often
watch the finny tribe below in their plays and gambols&mdash;is
better to me than a thousand anywhere else.&nbsp; The waters of
the Tawe are to me a source of exquisite delight, an unspeakable
charm.&nbsp; I could gaze upon them for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, comely youth,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;you
speak what you know, and I must own to being charmed with your
enthusiasm.&nbsp; You are young, and your vision is
contracted.&nbsp; You are inexperienced; your world is bounded by
the surrounding horizon.&nbsp; If you will come with me, I will
show you fairer climes than these, more beautiful landscapes,
grander hills and mountains; vales infinitely more lovely, and
streamlets, brooks and rivers, which surpass in splendour and
sublimity all other <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>running waters of the world.&nbsp;
Besides, in my country, everything is beautiful.&nbsp; The gold
is as abundant there as are the stones on this lowland strand or
on ocean&rsquo;s tidal shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have drawn, sweet voice, a charming picture of your
country, but where is it?&nbsp; Is it an ideal or a real
kingdom?&nbsp; If it be real, I would visit if I knew the
way.&nbsp; Pray tell me the road which leads to a world so
resplendently beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair youth,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;the road is
nigh thee; it is close to where thou sleepest.&nbsp; I will
conduct thee there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one condition only will I be thy
companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name your condition, and if it be in my power, it shall
be granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you solemnly promise to guide me back again to my
own native sphere, in the event of my failing to find the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I promise.&nbsp; Further, you shall have perfect
liberty to stay, or to return to this upper world, at any time
you desire.&nbsp; I will, too, be your companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;But who art thou?&nbsp; What, too, is thy
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a prince of my kingdom; and my name is
Tippin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your highness&rsquo; position at the royal
court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am chancellor of my royal master, King Penaf, the
wisest and best of monarchs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray prince, is your king a giant like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In wisdom, yes.&nbsp; But fair youth, you should judge
all men, not by their stature, but by their wise words, weighty
sayings, and just decrees.&nbsp; The mind is the standard of man,
for mind is the man.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let us tarry
longer.&nbsp; Awake! awake! oh sleeper; arise from your couch of
sand; let us away, for my hour of departure has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I awoke, I found myself being carried through a
dimly-lighted tunnel on the wings of the wind; I say on the wings
of the wind for I was not conscious that any palpable substance
touched my body.&nbsp; The further we receded from the earth, the
wider and loftier became the <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>subterranean passage; and by means
of the dim light, I discerned rocks of gold and precious
stones.&nbsp; When we arrived at the end of the passage, there
appeared in the distance a scene which filled my bosom with
wonder and admiration; never had I previously beheld such a
combination of beauty.&nbsp; How shall I describe it!&nbsp; This
I cannot do, for it passes description; far grander, infinitely
grander, was the scene than anything I had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>In the distance were high hills and Alpine heights, plains and
meads, and dells, which were covered with grass of emerald
green.&nbsp; I could see neither sun, nor moon, nor stars; but
the country was illumined by a beautiful blue soft light which
was delightful, and most agreeable to the eye.&nbsp; Between day
and night, there appeared no perceptible difference; while in
those regions, summer and winter, spring and autumn, were
unknown.&nbsp; Their year was distinguished by no seasons; they
enjoyed a perpetual spring.&nbsp; Beautiful was their clime,
exquisitely lovely was their country, singular and mysterious
were the people.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>As
regards the climate, it had no variation.&nbsp; There was always
there a soft, gentle, and warm breeze; which produced the most
delectable sensation.&nbsp; This breeze appeared to possess
life-giving and life-sustaining properties.&nbsp; When it came,
as it sometimes did, in stronger currents than was generally the
case, the old would repair to the mountain tops or bwllchs, and
after two or three hours&rsquo; stay would return to the plain
strong, blooming, and hale.&nbsp; But more of this anon.</p>
<p>Immediately after our arrival in the open country, the prince
conducted me in silence to a building, the walls of which were
formed of the finest marble.&nbsp; Its entrance was guarded by
two little men, even less in stature than my conductor, who made
obeisance as we passed.&nbsp; The prince conducted me up a flight
of stairs, and then through several rooms, containing rich and
costly furniture; at last we came to a door on which was printed
in letters of gold &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Chamber.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This chamber we entered.&nbsp; Having placed a chair beside me
for my use, he then walked to the other side of the chamber,
where there was <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>a curious instrument fastened to a silver slab, and
touched a small spring.&nbsp; There was attached to the
instrument a thread or wire of the most delicate workmanship,
which quivered at the touch; presently I heard the sound of a
bell, which was followed by several ticks, and when the ticks
ceased, the prince remarked that the royal carriage from Dinas
Aur would arrive there in half an hour, in order to take us to
the golden city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how far is it to your city?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The actual distance is one hundred and twenty
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your carriage travels more swiftly than the flight
of the bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is it safe to go so fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your assurance contents me.&nbsp; Will you, please,
answer me one question, namely: as you appear to travel about 250
miles in an hour, I want to know in what consists your motive
power?&nbsp; Surely your horses can&rsquo;t travel so rapidly as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;Oh no; we don&rsquo;t use horses.&nbsp; In these
regions we make nature administer to our every want.&nbsp; We
shall travel through the air, which we use to propel us along;
more I cannot say, as this singular phenomenon is beyond my
comprehension.&nbsp; The thing was discovered by our wise men,
who keep the secret in their own breasts.&nbsp; Look, my young
friend,&rdquo; said the prince, addressing me; &ldquo;the
carriage is coming, do you observe its approach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I looked, I saw something like a black spot in the air;
it appeared like a small bird.&nbsp; Presently it became more
distinct, and before I was really aware, the royal carriage had
arrived, having come nearly five minutes earlier than we
expected.&nbsp; At once we stepped into the royal saloon.&nbsp;
Presently I discovered the carriage moving.&nbsp; When we
ascended some twenty yards above the earth, we were carried at a
fearful pace through the air; I perceived it was kept up by means
of wings, which were made of material which in appearance was
silk.&nbsp; These wings were of great dimensions, but were
extended or contracted in size according to the power and force
<a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>of the
current.&nbsp; The propelling agency was compressed air, but how
this worked, and whether it was combined with other gases or not,
I could not learn.&nbsp; I found the travelling exceedingly
pleasant; when I closed my eyes I could not detect the least
motion.&nbsp; Objects came and went, we appeared to pass them as
rapidly as the moving clouds in a terrible storm, or falling
stars on a bright November night.&nbsp; We arrived at our
destination a few minutes earlier than we anticipated.&nbsp; The
prince conducted me to the royal palace, and placing me in charge
of some important state functionary, repaired to the council of
his royal master; when he left, he said he would not be long, and
on returning he would join me for the evening.&nbsp; I must own,
that I felt extremely sorry to have to part, even for a short
time, from one who was so kind and so agreeable; and I felt this
the more in consequence of the peculiar position in which I was
placed.&nbsp; I was now the denizen of a strange world, and
surrounded by a strange race.</p>
<p>During the absence of Prince Tippin I began to realize my
position.&nbsp; I thought what <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>a fool I was in leaving my home and
country, the anxiety my absence would cause my parents, and the
uncertainty of my ever seeing them again.&nbsp; This thought
deeply moved me.&nbsp; I was exceedingly uneasy in both mind and
conscience; I could neither sit nor lie still for three
consecutive minutes.&nbsp; At last, after examining every article
in the room, I asked the attendant if he could give me any kind
of book or writing material, by the aid of which I hoped to
forget myself.&nbsp; The attendant informed me that they did not
use books, that their knowledge was orally handed down from
father to son, from the priests to the people, and thus all the
inhabitants became wise.</p>
<p>When the prince returned dinner was served up in the
ante-room,&mdash;a fine hall, radiantly lighted up.&nbsp; Our
first course was soup made of choice herbs, which was not only
extremely satisfying but exceedingly palatable.&nbsp; Of this I
partook heartily.&nbsp; When the dishes were removed our
attendant brought in milk thickened with meal, coloured with
saffron; this was served up in basins of gold.&nbsp; <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>Afterwards
we had tarts, pies, and fruit of the most delicious flavour; the
fruit resembled the pear, but was sweeter and more juicy.</p>
<p>After the meal was over, I asked the prince if he would give
me a glass of wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;I
regret to be unable to comply with your wish.&nbsp; Wines, and
all kinds of alcoholic drinks, are prohibited from being used by
the law of the State; I dare not, therefore, supply you with this
beverage, even if I had it in my possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, excellency, have you such a singular
law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For various reasons.&nbsp; Would you wish to be
furnished with the cause of the existence of such an
enactment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will confer upon me a personal favour by stating
the reasons for the existence of such a regulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the reasons.&nbsp; We want the minds of our
people to be clear and bright, and their intellectual vision
unclouded.&nbsp; Is not that important?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again; in these dominions, crime, destitution, poverty,
pauperism, and wrong-doing are unknown; but if our people, like
yours, imbibed spirituous liquors, crimes would be as frequent
and poverty as widely spread as are those terrible evils in your
kingdom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I readily admit the force of your reasoning; I am bound
to own that the drinking customs of my country are the real
causes of our more serious national evils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, your government ought to enact stringent
laws in order to diminish the cause of those evils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a race of free men, living in a free country,
and I am afraid that no government will for some years be strong
enough to battle successfully with this custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pass laws to suppress vice; and drunkenness being
one of the greatest vices of your people, and the parent of all
others, I can see no reason why you should not put down this
traffic by legislation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;Your excellency may be right in your
conclusion.&nbsp; The evil is a terrible blot on our
civilization; were we a strictly sober race, we should be by far
the grandest people on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own observations lead me to the same conclusion; but
for the present we must put an end to the argument.&nbsp; It is
time for you to retire.&nbsp; Your attendant awaits you.&nbsp;
To-morrow we shall meet again, though I am afraid only for a few
minutes, as I have to pay a visit to a distant part of the
empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning I breakfasted alone.&nbsp; Though I saw
during the morning several of the little people passing along the
lawn in front of my window, I did not venture to speak to them,
nor did any member of the race pay me a visit.</p>
<p>About midday the door of my room was opened, and a little
gentleman walked into the hall, and, without saying a word, sat
down in a vacant chair opposite the one on which I was
seated.&nbsp; After examining my <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>appearance, he observed, &ldquo;I
presume you are the stranger who accompanied Prince Tippin to the
palace last evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the stranger, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the attendant has shown you every courtesy, and
has not been wanting in hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the prince and attendant I have received every
consideration; and as for the fare, sir, I might have gone
further and fared worse.&nbsp; I like your food much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very different country from yours, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes; widely different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you find it strange to have light without a
sun or moon or stars?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I miss the genial light of the sun; but
there is a softness, a reflected beauty, in the light here which
we do not possess in our diurnal luminary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our light is uniform, as is our climate.&nbsp; In the
northern regions of your country the sun constantly shines during
several months of your year, which is followed by continuous <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>darkness or
night, when the inhabitants have to reside in snow or ice-built
houses.&nbsp; Dreary must be the life of a people so
circumstanced.&nbsp; You have in your climate genial and joyous
spring, when nature revives from the dead and puts on her
youthful and gay apparel, when the thorn, the citron, and the
apple-tree bud and blossom;&mdash;beautiful is your spring, the
loveliest and most charming season of your year.&nbsp; Then comes
your summer, with its green meads, and fields of waving corn, and
rich fruit.&nbsp; No artist can paint, no language can set forth,
the grandeur of your clime during autumn.&nbsp; What have you
afterwards?&nbsp; Cold, icy, and chilling winter, with its dank
and cold atmosphere; with your hills, mountains, and even your
dales, covered with snow.&nbsp; In winter your country seems
dead, clay-like, and lifeless; sad and dreary to me is your
winter scene.&nbsp; In this land we have perpetual spring.&nbsp;
In all the months of the year the orange, the citron, and the
apple-tree send forth their buds and blossoms and their ripe and
rich fruit; our valleys and <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>mountains are always green, a
circumstance which to you, doubtless, appears very
strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Is that really so?&nbsp; Do your fields
and trees and hillsides present at all times the same hue?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the colour never alters, and nature in this region
is never weary in its development, and never halts in the
manifestation of her power; she goes from strength to strength,
and with increased vigour as the years roll on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; A strange phenomenon this!&nbsp; Can you
account for the existence of such perennial inherent power?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; Upon our mountains, valleys, and plains
there perpetually descend from above constant showers of ethereal
riches.&nbsp; Our earth thus daily receives from heaven even more
riches than she gives in flower and fruit, and grass, and
vegetable matter.&nbsp; Thus she daily and hourly becomes richer
and more bountiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; But suppose the spring, the perennial
fountain, of this life-giving bounty and luxuriance, were to fail
or to dry up, what <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>would be your position then?&nbsp; From whence could
you then obtain your supply?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of such a calamity we entertain no dread.&nbsp; For
thousands of years this process has been going on, and through
years unnumbered it will be continued.&nbsp; In your world there
is a gradual decay; nature there is exhausting herself.&nbsp; For
the present you have enough and to spare; but how will it be,
what will your people do, when the virgin soil of the world on
the other side of the Atlantic becomes exhausted?&nbsp; That time
must come; what will your people do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Before that day arrives humanity will
become etherealized, spirit-like, and super-mundane.&nbsp; As a
race, sir, we are not destined to continue the sordid, cloddy,
and vulgar eating people we now are.&nbsp; Oh, no; the earthly
tabernacle is to be put off, and we shall live on angels&rsquo;
food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your race then, sir, has the hope and prospect of
dwelling in a sphere beyond your present world?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Most assuredly.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;Who is to be the king of that world?&nbsp; Who
the ruler?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The king will be the great Unseen and
Eternal, the self-existent and self-created Being who rules
heaven&rsquo;s armies and earth&rsquo;s inhabitants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Being, is it not, whom your nation worship
and adore?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes; and we are to live with Him for
ever, and enjoy His fellowship.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t you believe
in Him too?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! no; I wish we did.&nbsp; When I consider how
beautiful our clime and country are,&mdash;our friendship,
associations, consciousness, friends, relations,&mdash;I often
shudder at the thought of annihilation.&nbsp; Sometimes I am
terribly oppressed with the thought of ceasing to be, and the
more thoughtful of my race hold similar opinions and
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What do you and your people
worship?&nbsp; Who is the object of your adoration?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worship truth; a thing not a person; an idea, not a
reality; a form, beautiful though <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>it be, and not a substance.&nbsp; It
is awful to think that the grave is to be the end of our joys,
pleasures, and delights.&nbsp; In the matter of worship, you are
right and we are wrong; you are the wise ones, we the
fools.&nbsp; But you have, methinks, too much of form in your
manner of worshipping your Supreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I agree with your last remark; but pray
tell me how you have acquired such an intimate knowledge of our
affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By frequent visits to your land, and by mixing with
your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I never saw a member of your race until I
was fortunate enough to meet Prince Tippin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; but I have traversed the whole of your
country, as well as other countries beyond the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Is that really so?&nbsp; You certainly
astonish me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice every year, in your spring time and autumn, I
visit your world on affairs of state.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Then there dwell in other climes a
kindred people, a race like your own?</p>
<p><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>&ldquo;Certainly; and I have often paid them a friendly
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; In what parts of the country do they
live?</p>
<p>&ldquo;In several parts.&nbsp; In fair Mona&rsquo;s Isle there
dwell the Pobli Bach.&nbsp; In East Anglia is the race of the
Plantos.&nbsp; In Germany, living on the banks of the Rhine, are
the Pobli Wyn.&nbsp; In France, Spain, Italy, and the East there
are different tribes inhabiting a precisely similar country to
this.&nbsp; And their habits, customs, mode of life and
government, are all identical with ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And do you live in peace with each
other?&nbsp; Do you never quarrel, and go to war, and kill each
other in battle?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no!&nbsp; We live at peace.&nbsp; According to
our code of morals, it is very wicked to take away or destroy
life.&nbsp; Of all things in our world life is the
beautifullest.&nbsp; We are shocked, and pained, and grieved in
witnessing the contentions between the peoples of your
world.&nbsp; In our view it is awful to use your arts, skill, and
wealth, in <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>making instruments, and in training and paying men, to
kill and destroy.&nbsp; Yet you call yourselves
Christians!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; In my conscience I believe we are
wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do; do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Assuredly I do.&nbsp; I believe war is
wrong; is hateful to high heaven; is contrary to the principles
of the gospel, which command us to love one another.&nbsp; From
God comes life.&nbsp; He sustains it.&nbsp; He only has a right
to take it away.&nbsp; In man we see His image.&nbsp; Of one
blood He has made us all.&nbsp; Although we are brothers, yet we
act towards each other as if we were the children of the evil
one.&nbsp; But a time will come when strife and contention shall
cease, when there shall exist universal harmony, a harmony
founded on the law of Christ, which is the law of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised at your confession.&nbsp; The opinion
you hold on this question is directly contrary to that held by
your teachers.&nbsp; Why, your ministers preach the doctrine that
war is in harmony with your faith.&nbsp; Is not that
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I must own that that is so.&nbsp;
Still I believe them to be in error, and hope they will discover
their error before it is too late.&nbsp; I am afraid that a great
deal of the scepticism of the times is principally owing to the
want of harmony between the truth and the profession of it.&nbsp;
As a race we don&rsquo;t practically live out the precepts of our
faith.&nbsp; Hence the reason why men of the world scorn
religious men, and you know contempt usually ends in
disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have not the light you have, still we are a purer
and a more virtuous people than yours.&nbsp; We are sober and
temperate, but your race is not.&nbsp; We live in peace, never
engage in war, but you kill each other with the sword and the
bow.&nbsp; Then as our climate is so superior to yours, why not
stay with us for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I could not live without seeing my father
and mother; without visiting the upper world in order to bask
occasionally on the sylvan banks of Tawe&rsquo;s crystal waters;
to gaze on the blue heavens, with their twinkling <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>stars; to
wander about the green meads, and listen to the rich melody of
the winged songsters of the grove and primeval forest; but I
should like to visit you now and then.&nbsp; Before I return I am
anxious to see and have converse with your king, the rather that,
as the prince informed me, he is a wise and virtuous ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rejoice that the prince has spoken so well of his
master.&nbsp; I am the king, and I thank you for speaking so
freely of your country and its people.&nbsp; Whenever you choose
to pay us a visit, be assured you shall be heartily
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; May it please your majesty, your majesty
has treated me as if I were a prince instead of a poor
fisherman&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Your majesty&rsquo;s kindness and
hospitality I shall ever remember with gratitude.&nbsp; I accept
your invitation, and I will certainly pay another visit to your
beautiful country.</p>
<p><i>The King</i>.&nbsp; At all times you shall be heartily
received.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Thanks; a thousand thanks.&nbsp; Were <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>I not a
Welshman, I would dwell in your beautiful land.</p>
<p><i>The King</i>.&nbsp; You have spoken handsomely of my
dominions.&nbsp; But here comes the prince; he shall conduct you
to the sylvan banks of your beautiful river, a river you so much
love.</p>
<p>Before setting out on my homeward journey, I briefly inspected
the royal carriage.&nbsp; I now discovered, what had previously
escaped my notice, that underneath, and attached to the side of
the carriage, were inflated skins filled with natural gas.&nbsp;
These gave a buoyancy to the machine.&nbsp; Indeed, it was only
by the use of strong ropes made of grass that it was kept on the
earth.&nbsp; On stepping into the carriage, these ropes were
unhooked; it then began to ascend, and on reaching an altitude of
forty yards we got into what the prince called node currents,
which carried us along at the rate of 300 miles an hour.&nbsp; We
soon reached the public buildings referred to in a previous part
of my story, and from thence he conducted me through the <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>subterranean passage until we reached fair Tawe&rsquo;s
shore.</p>
<p>I urged the prince to accompany me to my parents&rsquo;
cottage, which he declined.&nbsp; He said that he had a special
engagement with the fairies of East Anglia&mdash;having arranged
to spend the night with them at their annual dance on the verdant
fields below Derwent Fawr.&nbsp; I subsequently learnt, that
Prince Tippin was engaged to a princess of the above tribe, of
the name of Titania; and that they frequently met on
Derwent&rsquo;s green fields &ldquo;to dance the nights to the
whistling wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On entering my home I found my parents mourning for me as one
who was dead.&nbsp; At first they would not believe me to be
their son, but thought it was their son&rsquo;s spirit which had
come to visit them.&nbsp; I soon convinced them of being still in
the flesh,&mdash;that I was no ghost, no spirit.&nbsp; I had then
to give them a history of my travels, to tell them of the strange
sights I had seen, the singular people I had met, the character
of the kingdom I had visited; but on my telling them of the <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>gold and
precious stones with which the land abounded, my mother upbraided
me for coming away without a large lump of gold.&nbsp; I told her
that I did not covet other people&rsquo;s property, and that I
should have acted extremely wrong had I taken away the gold of a
people from whom I had received so much kindness.</p>
<p>I remained at home for several weeks, and occasionally went to
school.&nbsp; I found my old enemy as cruel as ever, and I came
to the conclusion that on the very first opportunity I would
return to the fairy kingdom beneath the bay.</p>
<p>On wandering along the strand one fine morning, I was hailed
by a voice I could never forget.&nbsp; The prince informed me
that having just returned from visiting his fair Titania, he was
about to return to Dinas Aur, and urged me to return with
him.&nbsp; I readily yielded to his wishes, and sending a message
to my parents where I had gone, we started off, and returned by
means of the a&euml;rial carriage.</p>
<p>As I anticipated, my return to Dinas Aur, was hailed with
extreme delight by the few <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>persons I had come in contact with
on my previous visit.&nbsp; His majesty the king gave me a hearty
welcome, and expressed a hope that I would continue to sojourn in
his dominions at least for a season.&nbsp; I expressed my
gratitude to his majesty for his extreme kindness, and informed
him that as my parents were acquainted with the place of my
abode, I was the less anxious to return home than if that
knowledge was not in their possession.</p>
<p>The king replied, that I had shown, by sending the message I
had, that I was a dutiful son, fond of my mother and father, that
I had shown I did not want to give them a moment&rsquo;s
uneasiness and pain.&nbsp; His majesty then dismissed me, and
placed me under the special protection of his chancellor, Prince
Tippin.&nbsp; This arrangement afforded me inexpressible
satisfaction and delight, as on all occasions I had received from
him every consideration and courtesy.</p>
<p>In my subsequent intercourse with the prince, I found him to
be a man without prejudice, wholly free from bigotry, and in <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>all
circumstances never showing the least indication of
passion.&nbsp; He loved purity and goodness wherever he found
those virtues.&nbsp; He abominated cant, and loathed low tricks
which no one who wished to be regarded as honourable would resort
to in order to gain a special end.&nbsp; In his own beautiful
language, which I soon learned, he would use a string of
adjectives to characterize that class of men, who are mean,
selfish, unprincipled; men who have no claim to be admitted into
the society of pure and noble and unselfish individuals.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said one day to me, &ldquo;at your public
men, from the highest to the lowest; they are influenced by the
love of power and fame, and you find that when a particular end
is to be secured they are indifferent as to the means to be
employed.&nbsp; In appointing persons to fill important posts,
the claims of your best men are wholly ignored.&nbsp; You sadly
want men at the head of your affairs who are just, magnanimous,
and patriotic, men who are simply ambitious to secure the welfare
and weal of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I must own, your excellency, that <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>there is
too much truth in your strictures and censures.&nbsp; But we are
improving, and shall ultimately become a pure and perfect
race.&nbsp; Are there no persons of the class you have described
in your country?&nbsp; Is your race perfectly free from
selfishness and faction?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; we are all equal.&nbsp; As citizens and
subjects we occupy the same position.&nbsp; Our best men occupy
all posts in the civil government of the country.&nbsp; Here
again, all people readily obey the law: delinquents are banished
the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have you not frequent occasion to put the
law in force?</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means.&nbsp; There is only one case on record for
one hundred years in which the law has been rigorously carried
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You must be a law-observing people.&nbsp;
I wish from my heart that our race were as pure as yours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would be were your rulers as wise as
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Then you think that our leading men are
inferior to yours?</p>
<p><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>&ldquo;Think!&nbsp; I know they are.&nbsp; The history
of your country proves this.&nbsp; But we must drop the subject
now.&nbsp; I have an engagement with my royal master at this
hour, and I must hasten to the council chamber, for I fear his
majesty has already gone there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper, and just as I was about to retire to my chamber,
I received a visit from the Princess Mervyna and her two little
sisters.&nbsp; They were attended by their maid, who, though she
was smaller in stature than her mistress, was evidently many
years her senior.&nbsp; The Princess Mervyna introduced herself,
and said that she had come to command me to join them at their
sports the next day.&nbsp; I expressed regret to the princess at
being unable to comply with her wish, having previously arranged
to accompany the chancellor to a distant part of the
kingdom.&nbsp; I told her that I should regard it as a high
honour to join them at their games the day after.&nbsp; She
acquiesced in this, though she was evidently a little vexed as
well as disappointed with the arrangement.&nbsp; However, she
gave me a <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>gracious bow, and on retiring, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
forget your promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; I again assured her I would
not.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon before Prince Tippin and I started off from
the city on the following day.&nbsp; We had the same carriage as
the one we had used on previous occasions, and we proceeded at an
equally rapid pace.</p>
<p>After a flight of 140 miles, we descended to the earth on the
top of a high mountain, which in their language was called
Wyddfa, or Conspicuous, from which position we had a magnificent
prospect of the country.&nbsp; In the distance we beheld seas
like glass, on which apparently were myriads of little people,
some of whom were engaged in skating, others in bowling balls
along the ice, others were playing cricket, while not a few were
dancing to the music of the wind.&nbsp; We observed a great
number of the little folks playing with golden balls, which they
propelled along the ice by means of a crook.</p>
<p>Though the players went along the ice at a fearful pace, yet I
did not observe a single person fall.</p>
<p><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>Between us and the players there was a beautiful
undulating country, which abounded with streamlets and sylvan
dells, and the peculiar soft light of the region brought out the
deep green of the foliage to a degree I had not previously
beheld.&nbsp; The scene was exquisitely lovely, so rich in tint
and colour as to leave an indelible impression upon the
mind.&nbsp; Indeed and in truth this was a fairyland, an
enchanted ground, though to my vision it was real, palpable, and
actual.&nbsp; I became rooted to the spot, for never had I beheld
a scene so full of beauty.&nbsp; I was awakened from my reverie
by the familiar voice of the prince, who called out,
&ldquo;Elidorus!&nbsp; Elidorus! our time is up; we must haste
over other mountains and valleys, over streamlets and rivers, for
we have a long distance yet to go, and but a short time to travel
it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On taking our seat in the a&euml;rial carriage, the prince
informed me that we should not stop again until arriving at our
journey&rsquo;s end, and that on passing a rocky headland we
could <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>see in the distance, we should have a capital view of
the city of the plain.&nbsp; When we passed the place alluded to,
the city appeared in sight, but the houses and palaces were
buried in the rich green foliage of trees, which grew in every
street.&nbsp; As we were proceeding at a fearful pace, we had
only a glance at the city as we passed over it.</p>
<p>On arriving at our destination, we were conducted by a little
gentleman clad in rich apparel to the Hall of Brotherhood, which
we found was crowded with the principal inhabitants of the
city.&nbsp; The prince was conducted to the chair of
honour&mdash;a kind of throne, and he motioned me to occupy the
vacant seat on his right hand.&nbsp; Presently the prince asked
the governor of the city if peace, good-will, and concord reigned
there?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tranquillity and brotherly love still continue,&rdquo;
replied the governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever so live,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;for peace
is one of the cardinal virtues of all good citizens.&nbsp; I wish
to know, sir governor, <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>if your city is free from sickness,
disease, and fevers; and if not, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bloom of health, your excellency,&rdquo; replied
the governor, &ldquo;is on the cheeks of all.&nbsp; And
why?&nbsp; Our people drink only the pure waters of the crystal
fountain.&nbsp; They inhale the constant current of vital air,
which flows here like a tidal wave, and it imparts life, energy,
power, and joy to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor then retired and left the hall.&nbsp; When the
door was closed, the prince asked the citizens if they had any
charge to make or any complaint to bring against the
governor.&nbsp; They all rejoined that they had not any
complaint, but that, on the contrary, his conduct met with the
hearty approval of all.&nbsp; Presently the council came to an
end, and soon afterwards we returned home.</p>
<p>On the following morning I was awakened by a gentle knock at
my chamber door.&nbsp; Presently the door was opened, whereupon
my waiting attendant walked in.&nbsp; He informed me that the
Princess Mervyna had <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>already called, and that she and the
royal party were ready to proceed to their place of rendezvous,
having arranged to have a grand day in honour of my visit.&nbsp;
I felt very much annoyed at having overslept myself, and still
more vexed at keeping the little lady and her friends waiting
me.&nbsp; I only took a few minutes to dress, and having taken a
basin of warm milk, proceeded in search of the royal party, who
had already taken their seats in the king&rsquo;s carriage.&nbsp;
The princess and her little brother and sisters gave me a cordial
greeting.&nbsp; I soon found that we had left the earth and were
travelling due south of my previous day&rsquo;s voyage, and
before I fully realized my position we had descended on the
identical sea of ice where I had seen the games being carried on
on the preceding morning.</p>
<p>On leaving the carriage the party broke up into sections, some
joining parties who had already arrived from other cities of the
kingdom; others joining other parties who appeared of a <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>different
race from the natives.&nbsp; The princess acted as my cicerone
during the day, and she laughed heartily on seeing me now and
then unable to retain my balance on the slippery ice.&nbsp; Had
it not been for her presence of mind, I certainly should have
fallen on several occasions.&nbsp; Towards the evening I joined
in the games, though I found myself but an indifferent
player.&nbsp; We wound up the day&rsquo;s f&ecirc;te by a dance
on the ice to the music of the harp.&nbsp; Never shall I forget
the scenes of that day.&nbsp; The hopping and skipping, the
dancing and romping of the little people, who tried to excel each
other in mirth and fun: the scene produced an impression on my
mind which the iron hand of time will never deface or
remove.&nbsp; On our return to the palace, we were all ushered
into the banqueting hall, where a grand feast awaited us.&nbsp;
After dinner, Mervyna related to the king, her father, the
principal incidents of the day; and the good monarch was highly
amused at her stories of my difficulties and mishaps.&nbsp; When
the banquet was over I retired to my apartment, where I was soon
joined by Prince Tippin.</p>

<p>It was a calm and balmy evening in the month of July,
18&mdash;, when all nature appeared hushed in still quietude and
death-like repose, when not a zephyr breeze, causing the leaves
of the trees to murmur or wave, was felt: such was the character
of the lovely and sunny evening on which I left the beautiful
valley in which the little village of Llanwrtyd nestles among the
hills, for the purpose of paying a special visit to Cefn-y-Bedd,
the spot to which the finger of tradition points as the
resting-place, the sacred ground, the hallowed earth in which
were deposited&mdash;amid the universal wail and lamentation of
the Cambrian people, when widows, fathers, brothers and sisters,
heroes not a few, men who never dreaded danger, and who <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>were always
foremost in battle&mdash;strong, fearless, and valiant warriors,
wept and sorrowed, and refused to be comforted because their
Prince, their champion, and their idol was not.&nbsp; It was at
Cefn-y-Bedd, which is now a respectable farm homestead, where no
monument of any kind marks the spot, that the mortal remains of
Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, the last reigning sovereign of Wales, were
interred.&nbsp; If no Parian marble marks the ground beneath
whose sacred sod lies the dust of the dear departed, his name
still survives, his virtues still live, his memory is still
fondly cherished by hundreds and thousands of his descendants;
and though nearly six centuries have come and gone since the fall
of our great captain, prince, and patriot, he still speaks to the
people and the nation.&nbsp; Yes; his name is still dear to
Cambria&rsquo;s sons and daughters.&nbsp; His memory is even now,
after the lapse of so many years, fresh and green.&nbsp; If the
poor flesh, which contained one of the purest and manliest souls
that ever dwelt in a tabernacle of clay, has long, long ago
crumbled into dust, the man, the hero, and the patriot survive,
and will live <a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>in the annals of his country, and be an idol in the
heart of his descending race until time shall be no more.</p>
<p>I have remarked that the above visit was a &ldquo;special
visit.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days previous I had passed Cefn-y-Bedd,
on my way to the little border town of Builth, but in passing by
the sacred shrine of our illustrious ancestor, I knew not that I
was on hallowed ground.&nbsp; A lady companion called my
attention to an admirable husbandry arrangement of the homestead,
the like of which I had not previously seen in Breconshire.&nbsp;
The observation of my companion and the scene around led me into
a train of thought relating to bygone years, to the deeds of old,
the revolution of kingdoms, the decline and fall of empires, and
the changes which are daily taking place in families, in
governments, and in the homes of both rich and poor.&nbsp; I said
to myself, every house, every cottage, every mountain and valley
has a history peculiar to itself&mdash;a history full of
interest, replete with romantic doings and sayings far more
wonderful,&mdash;embodying events and circumstances of <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>more
profound interest and of deeper and far more pathetic
story&mdash;than is often found in the works of fiction.&nbsp;
Who can tell, for I am sure I cannot, but that, perhaps, that
house, with its farm-yard and out-buildings, its garden and
flowers, possesses a history peculiar to itself? and it may be
that long, long ago heroes and mighty men of valour took shelter
here from the fury of the tempest or from the burning sun of
mid-day July heat, in their march from one battle-field to
another.&nbsp; But why travel to the land of shadows?&nbsp; Why
draw ideal pictures of events that are past, of heroes, warriors,
and statesmen, of battles, conquests, and defeats?&nbsp; The dead
cannot be called to life.&nbsp; The past cannot be revived.&nbsp;
The work done cannot be undone.&nbsp; The past can never be
recalled.&nbsp; Well, if these things are among the
impossibilities of life, there is one thing at any rate which I
can do.&nbsp; I can drop a tear on the grave which contains the
hallowed dust.&nbsp; I can recall the memories of the dear
departed; I can paint and set forth their virtues, can photograph
their manliness and bravery, can sketch and limn <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>their life
and deeds; so that this and succeeding generations may learn to
live more wisely, be more true, more faithful to the dearest
interests of their country, especially with reference to those
measures which lie at the basis of national progress and the
comfort and weal of the people.</p>
<p>The situation of Cefn-y-Bedd is exquisitely beautiful, and the
scenery is richly diversified.&nbsp; From it one beholds a wide
expanse of country, with varied and magnificent views, which are
finely alternated with luxuriant fertile meadows, groves of
thriving timber, and flourishing plantations.&nbsp; In the
distance we have views of the rocky hills of Llanelwedd, at whose
base flows the poetic and majestic Wye, the beautifullest of
rivers.&nbsp; To the south-east is the far-famed Eppynt Forest,
and down through a luxuriant sylvan dell runs the meandering
Irvon.&nbsp; From this sacred spot one beholds at a glance
scenery in which are combined the bold and soft, the sterile and
woody, bare and rocky hills and verdant glades.&nbsp; It is a
scene on which the eye delights to dwell.&nbsp; In the far
distance the bald <a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>rocks of Aberedw appear in view.&nbsp; It was among
those rocks that Llewelyn encamped before his departure for
Builth.&nbsp; Little did he fancy when he left that stronghold on
the cold winter&rsquo;s morning that his life was so near its
close.&nbsp; That he was surrounded by enemies, he was well
aware.&nbsp; That the armies of King Edward were in the immediate
vicinity of his camp he was fully cognizant of.&nbsp; His spies
had brought him information of the several posts occupied by the
English, and of his being in imminent danger of an attack from
various quarters of the combined hosts.&nbsp; Aberedw, though
admirably formed by nature for resisting an attack, when directed
from the Wye banks, was yet wholly untenable in the face of the
terrible odds with which he had now to cope&mdash;a combined army
moving from various military posts.&nbsp; Seeing his danger, the
Cambrian prince resolved to break up his camp, and march along
the sylvan Wye to Builth.&nbsp; Crossing the bridge, he moved on
in a southwesterly direction to Pont Orewyn, where the Prince,
unarmed, received the deadly spear.&nbsp; <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>He was
killed on the 10th of December, 1282.</p>
<p>Having introduced to the notice of my readers the hero of my
story&mdash;the man whom Heaven, in its wisdom, specially raised
up to meet the demands of the most trying emergency which had
befallen a great and an heroic people&mdash;the man who, when
placed at the head of affairs, found his country prostrate, the
national treasury empty, and the people dispirited by reason of
sad reverses&mdash;I shall proceed now to sketch the career of
the man; to set forth his virtues; to paint, but with no
exaggerated colouring, his character as a prince, as a ruler, as
a military commander, and as a friend; and shall show, what
history clearly proves, that he inspired his countrymen with an
amount of confidence and trust which no previous sovereign had
been able to infuse into them; that the veneration with which his
name was so universally held was traceable to virtues in his
public acts and private life; further, that had it not been for
the treason of the faithless few, Llewelyn would have transmitted
the sovereignty of Wales to his posterity.&nbsp; <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>He died,
not on the field of battle, but alone and unarmed was he when the
fatal blow was struck.&nbsp; By-and-by I shall show that he had
done his work, and for him to die was gain.</p>
<p>On the right bank of the sylvan Wheeler,&mdash;a small crystal
stream which flows through the luxuriant and richly wooded vale
of Caerwys,&mdash;there stands the modern mansion of
Maesmynen.&nbsp; In a meadow near the present hall there was, in
the thirteenth century, an ancient palace, which from time
immemorial had been one of the royal residences of the Cambrian
Princes.&nbsp; Beautiful was the situation of this ancient
mansion.&nbsp; All that the eye loves to rest on could be seen
from the elevated spot on which it stood.&nbsp; This palace was
the favourite residence of the unfortunate Prince Llewelyn.&nbsp;
Here he spent his boyhood.&nbsp; Here he principally lived until
his country called him to occupy a more conspicuous and more
prominent position.&nbsp; In the neighbouring woods of Yseiefiog,
Caerwys, Trev-Edwyn, and Bodfari, he and his trusty friends were
accustomed to follow the chase.&nbsp; Indeed, he lived here among
<a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>friends
and dependents, for the circumjacent cantrevs of Rhos, Dyffryn
Clwyd, Rhyfoniog, and Englefield&mdash;which cantrevs included
the country between Conway and Chester&mdash;were his own
property and possessions.&nbsp; About midway between the two
extreme points was the royal palace of Maesmynen.&nbsp; Here he
breathed the pure air of heaven.&nbsp; Here he was free from the
turmoil of life&rsquo;s cares and life&rsquo;s battles.&nbsp;
Here he felt but little anxiety in connection with the terrible
war then being carried on between his countrymen, headed by
Llewelyn the Great, and, subsequent to the death, in 1240, of
that illustrious monarch, by his son and successor, Prince
Davydd; because the Prince of Maesmynen felt that the right men
were at the head of affairs, and that Heaven would defend the
cause of the just.&nbsp; Though Llewelyn, the last prince, was
not anxious as to the result of the struggle, yet that he was not
an indifferent spectator of the scene, and its consequences to
the nation, is evident from the annals of those momentous
times.&nbsp; Why then did he keep <a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>aloof from the struggle?&nbsp; Why
did he remain inactive?&nbsp; Why did he continue to live a life
of ease and pleasure, when duty called him to the front?&nbsp;
The reason is apparent when we consider the then existing
relation between members of the royal house.&nbsp; His father had
been cruelly treated, and had been made a prisoner by his own
brother Davydd; and when liberated, through the intervention of
mutual friends, he simply exchanged the castle of Criccaeth for
the Tower of London.&nbsp; In that stronghold he was securely
guarded by King Henry&rsquo;s soldiers.&nbsp; Some of his noble
compatriots, illustrious Cambrian chieftains, successfully
effected his release from the Tower, but Prince Gruffydd, the
father of our hero, in an endeavour to accomplish his own
liberation, fell from a great height and was killed on the
spot.&nbsp; It appears that that prince had made a cord with the
linen of his bed and table, and when he had descended about
midway between the window and the ground, the cord broke, and the
unhappy prince was precipitated into the Tower ditch, and was
killed.&nbsp; <a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>This sad event took place in the year 1244.&nbsp;
During the two following years, King Davydd, being wholly free
from anxiety on account of his brother&rsquo;s superior claim to
the throne, which his death had annulled, pursued a vigorous
policy, displaying traits of character and versatility of genius
of the highest order.&nbsp; He was brave as a lion, and was ever
foremost in the struggle; thus he secured the confidence of his
friends, the admiration of his followers, the love of his
soldiers, and the dread of his enemies.&nbsp; His reign, however,
was but of brief duration.&nbsp; In 1216 he died at Aber
Palace.&nbsp; Though this prince was hated by many during his
reign, his death was generally lamented.</p>
<p>When the solemn obsequies connected with the funeral of the
deceased prince were over, the Cambrian barons and chieftains met
in a national congress, and unanimously elected Prince
Llewelyn-ap-Gruffydd and his brother Owen as joint sovereigns of
Wales.&nbsp; The decision of the barons was hailed with the
liveliest satisfaction by the Cambrian people.&nbsp; The reason
of the existence of this feeling in <a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>favour of the two princes is
obvious.&nbsp; Their father had been the idol of the Welsh.&nbsp;
The people in both North and South Wales had felt that he had
been cruelly treated by his brother, that he had been unjustly
deprived of his inheritance, that his birthright had been taken
from him by unfair means (for he was the lawful successor to
Llewelyn the Great, the heir-apparent to the throne on his
decease), and hence that the crown belonged to him by
seniority.&nbsp; The people now rejoiced that the sons of the boy
hero who in his youth had made King Henry&rsquo;s army feel his
power, were about to be placed in possession of their lawful
inheritance as rulers and sovereigns of the Cambrian
nation.&nbsp; In the following pages I shall place before the
reader facts which show the wisdom of the choice which the
national congress made.</p>
<p>But I have no intention, indeed it is wholly foreign to my
present purpose, to write a life of Llewelyn, that is, a
consecutive narrative of his deeds and acts, and his grand
military achievements.&nbsp; In 1856 I compiled a biography <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>of my hero,
but it still remains in manuscript.&nbsp; Briefly stated, my
present purpose is to paint a likeness of the last prince of the
Cymru in three different aspects, that is, as a military
commander and tactician, as a Cambrian patriot, and as a citizen
and friend.&nbsp; Regarded in these several aspects, I shall,
from reliable data, make it perfectly clear that the prince was
as just as he was generous; that he commanded the respect, the
love, the affection and the admiration of all who came in contact
with him; that moreover, by his deeds of prowess, by the
manifestation of great skill and eminent military tactics, by the
rapidity with which he moved his army from one part of the
battle-field to another, from one point of attack to another
place which he regarded as vulnerable, he gained a title to be
regarded as one of the greatest generals of those eventful
times.&nbsp; He successfully resisted, and more than once
conquered, the bravest army then existing in Europe.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Welsh princes ascended the throne of
their ancestors, King Henry of <a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>England, at the head of a powerful
army, invaded North Wales.&nbsp; For this attack the Welsh
princes were wholly unprepared; and rather than risk an
engagement with such terrible odds against them, they prudently
retreated before the enemy, retiring to the mountain districts,
from which the English king failed to dislodge them.&nbsp;
Subsequently, but before Henry returned to England, a treaty of
amity and peace was concluded between the Cambrian and Saxon
monarchs.&nbsp; The conditions of this treaty were, first, that
Llewelyn was to give up possession for ever of his patrimony, the
four cantrevs; secondly, that he was to serve in Wales, or in the
Marches, with one thousand foot and twenty-four horse,&mdash;this
at his own expense; thirdly, that all the Welsh barons were to do
homage to the English monarch.&nbsp; That the conditions of this
treaty were most humiliating, we must at once admit; but under
the circumstances there can be no doubt that Llewelyn acted
wisely in acceding to them, for had he defied the enemy then, the
struggle would have proved a hopeless one.&nbsp; The peace <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>which he by
the treaty secured, lasted for a period of nine years, when
Llewelyn became (1254) the sole sovereign of Wales.&nbsp; From
that time until his untimely end, he reigned alone: nobly and
magnanimously did he wear the crown.&nbsp; His was a life without
a stain of dishonour, as pure and bright as the crystal fountain;
and he has left a name which will never die.&nbsp; Magnanimous
was he, generous and noble was he, chivalrous and princely in
mien and heart was he: hence the reason why he was almost
worshipped by all who came within the sacred circle of his
influence; and had he had a moiety of the power possessed by the
English monarchs, the issue of the struggle would have been
widely different.&nbsp; However, an all-wise Providence willed it
otherwise, and it is our duty to bow our heads without a murmur,
for He does all things in infinite love and wisdom.</p>
<p>After securing such important concessions from Llewelyn, the
English king, if be had been wise, would have pursued a mild and
conciliatory policy towards the nobles and barons <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>of the
Welsh nation: unfortunately for his reputation and statesmanship,
good-will towards the conquered formed no part of the imperial
virtues.&nbsp; He ruled with a rod of iron, the olive-branch
forming no part of the device upon the king&rsquo;s banner.&nbsp;
Thus the fruit of his policy soon became apparent.&nbsp; It would
be expecting more than human nature to suppose that the Cambrian
chieftains and barons would remain peaceful and quiet on seeing
their estates seized by lords Marchers.&nbsp; Moreover, the
greatest oppression was practised by minions of King Henry, and
for the most trivial offences the proud barons of Wales were
subjected to cruel and extreme punishment.&nbsp; As was natural,
his cruelties and his policy of confiscation produced everywhere
disaffection, and ultimately a spirit of implacable hate was
engendered.&nbsp; The people, to a man, were in the end ready to
rise in order to throw off the bitter yoke.&nbsp; They had their
leader, the brave prince Llewelyn; but the fruit was not yet
ripe.&nbsp; But while he urged delay, he did not neglect
preparation for the conflict, for he knew that the day of
conflict <a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>must come.&nbsp; When the hour arrived, Llewelyn took
the field, and his achievements far surpassed the most sanguine
expectations of both himself and his brave followers.&nbsp; In
the space of a single week he recovered from the enemy the
possessions they had acquired by war in North Wales and
Cardiganshire.&nbsp; Wherever he and his little army went, the
enemy was compelled to yield, and to retire from the battlefield
as defeated hosts.</p>
<p>Soon after these successes, Llewelyn led a large army into
South Wales.&nbsp; Before Dynevor Castle, near Llandilo, he
encountered the English forces, which were commanded by Rhys
Vychan.&nbsp; The battle was conducted with great skill and
bravery on both sides; but at last the king&rsquo;s army was
thoroughly beaten and retired from the field.&nbsp; Immediately
after this splendid victory, the Cambrian prince returned in
triumph to the North, where his subjects received him with
universal acclamation and heart-felt gratitude.&nbsp; But his
work now had only just commenced.&nbsp; On his arrival at Aber,
he found awaiting him a deputation from the <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>four
cantrevs,&mdash;tenants and chiefs residing on lands within his
patrimony,&mdash;who had come to lay before their prince and
friend the terrible wrongs they had to endure from the exactions
of Geoffrey de Langley, who farmed the crown lands under Prince
Edward of England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Llewelyn, to avenge their
injuries, crossed the frontier, carrying fire and sword to the
very gates of Chester, from the walls of which, Edward himself is
said to have been a galled witness of the havoc.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
this defeat Edward sought his father&rsquo;s aid, but he sought
it in vain: he then applied to his uncle, the king of the Romans,
for assistance; but the forces he was thereby able to bring to
the field were found either too cowardly or too weak to attack
the Welsh.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Cambrian prince with his army then
took a <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, they entered the territory of
Gruffydd ab Madog, lord of Dinas Br&acirc;n, a chief who had
formed a hostile league against Llewelyn and his native
land,&rdquo; upon whom he took ample revenge.&nbsp; On returning,
he suddenly met the English army, which was commanded by Prince
Edward in person.&nbsp; A terrible battle <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>was fought
between the Welsh and English armies; but at every point of the
line Llewelyn&rsquo;s troops were victorious.&nbsp; In this
conflict, Edward&rsquo;s forces were badly beaten, a small
remnant only escaping with their life.&nbsp; After a brief
repose, Llewelyn renewed his operations against the domains of
Edward, and these he carried on without meeting with any serious
opposition; but Llewelyn did not love war: in the hour of his
most splendid triumphs he was anxious for peace.&nbsp;
Immediately after his recent grand achievements, he wrote to King
Henry offering, &ldquo;if a peace were concluded, and the Welsh
restored to their ancient laws, to give a sum of money to Henry,
and to acknowledge his sovereignty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Considering his
late successes, we are surprised at his thus humbling himself to
his foe.&nbsp; Doubtless he made this offer because of the deep
solicitude he felt for the lives and property of his
people.&nbsp; This generous offer was rejected with scorn by
Henry, whereupon hostilities were recommenced with great and
increased vigour by both of the contending parties.</p>
<p><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>In
reviewing thus far the life and character of the Cambrian prince,
we have seen that his decision was always followed by prompt and
energetic action.&nbsp; Whenever he resolved to do a special
thing or to gain a certain point, he at once set about its
accomplishment.&nbsp; To this characteristic of the man is
traceable the secret of some of his mightiest achievements.&nbsp;
In the present case Llewelyn gained important victories before
the English monarch could collect his forces and approach
his&mdash;Llewelyn&rsquo;s&mdash;dominions.&nbsp; During the lull
the prince moved his army against the Lord of Powys, whom he
easily defeated.&nbsp; The tidings of this victory having been
carried to Gruffydd ab Madog, that chief felt that it would be
madness on his part to resist the Cambrian prince, and he
therefore sought and obtained a treaty of peace.&nbsp; Llewelyn
then marched against the Earl of Gloucester, whom he defeated in
a general battle.&nbsp; These successes and achievements roused
the Welsh to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.&nbsp; Accordingly
we find that the Cambrian barons and chiefs <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>entered
into a solemn league to defend till death the independence and
freedom of their country.&nbsp; This confederacy was formed in
the year 1258.&nbsp; On its being ratified the Cambrian prince
commenced to march southward, and gained easy victories over the
forces that were thrown forward to impede his progress.&nbsp; In
a subsequent campaign in South Wales he took the castle of
Maelienydd, in Radnorshire.&nbsp; Afterwards he invaded the
English borders on the west side of Shropshire and Cheshire,
where he gained important advantages over the lords
Marchers.&nbsp; From thence he proceeded to the castles of
Diserdd and Diganwy, which he besieged and destroyed.&nbsp; On
being apprised of these fresh disasters, Prince Edward marched
against Llewelyn, who retired to, and took refuge among, the
&ldquo;mountain bulwarks&rdquo; of Carnarvonshire.&nbsp; As
Edward dared not follow the Welsh prince there, he returned to
England, &ldquo;if not disgraced, at least without any particular
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pass over, as forming no part of my design, the insurrection
of De Montford, that <a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>nobleman&rsquo;s success against Sir
Roger Mortimer, and his triumph over Prince Edward, whom he kept
a prisoner in Hereford Castle.&nbsp; Further, I shall content
myself with a passing reference to the invasion of Glamorganshire
by Llewelyn, the important treaty of Montgomery in 1267 between
Henry and Llewelyn, and the death of the former five years
afterwards.</p>
<p>When Edward ascended the throne, be called upon Llewelyn to do
homage at his coronation.&nbsp; The Welsh prince replied that he
was prepared to comply with the mandate, provided some English
noblemen of distinction were sent to the Principality as hostages
for his security.&nbsp; The negotiations respecting the question
of homage, and the correspondence relating to the imprisonment of
Eleanor de Montford, Llewelyn&rsquo;s betrothed, were carried on
until the summer of 1277, when Edward, at the head of a numerous
body of vassals, invaded North Wales.&nbsp; Llewelyn&rsquo;s army
being small, he dared not risk a general battle, so he retired
and took refuge among the inaccessible defences of
Snowdon&mdash;a safe asylum, <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>a secure retreat on all occasions
when the commissariat department of the army was attended
to.&nbsp; Anglesey being now in the hands of the English, and
there existing disaffection among some of the South Wales
chieftains, the prince found himself so hemmed in that supplies
could not be obtained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Urged by the sufferings of
his famishing soldiers, and without any chance of relief,&rdquo;
and his betrothed still being a prisoner, Llewelyn was compelled
to sue for peace; but King Edward refused to entertain any
proposal short of an unconditional surrender.&nbsp; Under the
treaty which was then agreed to, it was stipulated that Llewelyn
was to do homage in London annually, to deliver up all prisoners,
to restore all forfeited lands, to resign the feudal supremacy
over his barons; and all the Welsh chieftains, excepting the five
barons of Snowdon, were to hold their lands direct from
Edward.&nbsp; The conditions of this treaty were strictly
observed by the Welsh prince for a period of about four
years.&nbsp; To his subjects those were years of suffering.&nbsp;
<a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>The
administration was corrupt; gross frauds were practised on the
Welsh; while oppression, tyranny, and cruelties characterized the
proceedings of the representatives of the Government.&nbsp; The
people complained of the wrongs which they sustained, and mildly
but firmly asked for a redress of their grievances; but a deaf
ear was turned to all the representations which were made.&nbsp;
At last the yoke became intolerable; they appealed to Prince
David for assistance, and that prince renounced his
&ldquo;unnatural allegiance to Edward,&rdquo; and became
reconciled to his brother Llewelyn; and the two princes and a
number of powerful and influential chieftains organized a
concerted movement with a view to drive the English from their
land and to re-establish the freedom and independence of their
country.&nbsp; Their cause was good, and their object just and
noble; but, ah me! they lacked the power and resources necessary
to accomplish their grand and holy purpose.</p>
<p>Llewelyn and his brother, having matured their plan of action,
at once commenced the <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>campaign.&nbsp; They jointly
invested the castle of Flint, on the estuary of the Dee; and from
thence they marched to and successfully attacked the castle of
Rhuddlan.&nbsp; The Cambrian army then moved along the coast, and
were hotly pursued by Edward, who overtook the retreating forces
near Conway.&nbsp; Here a general battle was fought between the
contending forces, in which the Welsh were victorious.&nbsp; On
his defeat the English king retired to Hope Dale, from which he
soon recommenced operations, and re-occupied Rhuddlan without
experiencing any opposition.&nbsp; From Rhuddlan he
&ldquo;despatched a part of his army by sea to take possession of
the Isle of Anglesey,&rdquo; and from thence, by means of a
bridge of boats, this section of the army crossed over the Menai
and landed at Moel-y-Don, near Bangor.&nbsp; When the reflux of
the tide had broken the communication between the artificial
bridge and the mainland, the Welsh army rushed from their
hiding-place, and nearly the whole number of the enemy were
either killed by the sword or perished in the waves.&nbsp; To <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>Edward this
was an unexpected disaster.&nbsp; For a moment it paralysed his
operations.&nbsp; He felt that he had underrated the strength and
undervalued the generalship of Llewelyn, and to make up for the
losses he had sustained he raised fresh levies throughout his
dominions.</p>
<p>During the preparations which were being made by Edward for
another campaign the Cambrian princes were not idle.&nbsp; They
arranged that the younger brother, Prince David, should be
entrusted with the defence of North Wales, while Llewelyn would
march against the English forces in South Wales.&nbsp; In the
county of Cardigan Llewelyn gained important victories against
the enemy; with a small body of troops he proceeded to the
vicinity of Builth, with a view to consult some chieftains of
that locality; and here, unattended and alone, this great, brave,
manly, heroic, and magnanimous prince fell by the hand of an
assassin.&nbsp; Thus perished, in the year 1282, after a reign of
twenty-eight years, Llewelyn, the last native prince of the
Cymry!</p>
<p><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>Having reviewed the military career of Llewelyn, I
shall proceed to make two or three observations respecting his
character as a ruler and citizen.&nbsp; We have abundant evidence
to prove that he was a profound lover of his country.&nbsp; He
loved her hills and dales, her mountains and valleys, her alpine
heights and cwms, or dells, with all the strong passion of a warm
and generous heart.&nbsp; Deeper than the love of home, of wife,
of kindred, of lands and possessions, was his affection for wild
Wales and its people.&nbsp; Of all countries in the wide world,
Wales was to him the brightest and fairest, and its people the
bravest and best.&nbsp; For her welfare, he sacrificed all he
had, all he possessed; and at last his life was immolated on his
dear country&rsquo;s shrine.&nbsp; As a citizen, he was generous
and kind.&nbsp; His heart was full of human sympathy, while his
spirit was one of the gentlest that ever dwelt in a tabernacle of
clay.&nbsp; Although he raised his country to a position of
military fame which she had not occupied in previous history, yet
war, in his view, had no glory.&nbsp; He loved <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>peace.&nbsp; He desired to live on terms of amity and
friendship with the English people and their rulers.&nbsp; But
alas! alas! those rulers were bent on the destruction of the
independence and freedom of his country.&nbsp; To prevent this,
he led his army against the foe, and for a time war smiled upon
him; but at last he fell, not in battle, but unarmed and alone,
stricken to the earth by an assassin.</p>
<p>Brief, comparatively brief, was the public life of Prince
Llewelyn; but grand, noble, and heroic were his deeds.&nbsp; He
lived for others, not for himself.&nbsp; For the welfare of his
country he laboured, not for personal aggrandizement.&nbsp; The
mainspring of his actions was the deep and intense love of
Fatherland.&nbsp; The great object for which he worked and fought
and suffered, for which he became a public man, the leader and
chief and ruler of a brave, a virtuous, an heroic people, was, to
secure the independence of his country, the freedom and liberty
of its people, and the blessing of permanent peace.&nbsp; To the
interests of the land of his birth, the home of his <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>father&rsquo;s sepulchre, he was ever true, ever
faithful, ever unswerving in fidelity and loyalty.&nbsp; If
others proved faithless, not so this patriotic prince.&nbsp; If
others of his countrymen forsook the true standard of national
independence, if they joined the ranks of the enemy with a view
to aid in crushing the liberties of an ancient people&mdash;a
race who could trace their history, without a single break in the
narrative, hundreds of years before the appearance of the Divine
Teacher on earth&mdash;Llewelyn felt it all the more necessary
for him to be more fearless in the fray, to put on a bolder and a
manlier front, to toil and to work more incessantly in the cause
which he felt was founded upon justice, upon right, and
equity.&nbsp; For a period of thirty-six years he carried on a
successful though an unequal struggle with the English monarchs
Henry and Edward.&nbsp; But few, very few, was the number of his
soldiers compared with the hosts who made up the armies that
fought under the banner of his country&rsquo;s foes.&nbsp; His
were brave men, and they were engaged in a struggle which <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>was dearer
and more sacred to them than life itself.&nbsp; They were true
soldiers.&nbsp; To fear they were strangers.&nbsp; Deeper than
the love of life, than the love of kindred, than the love of
estates and possessions, was their love and affection for
Fatherland.&nbsp; We hardly know which to admire the more, the
people or their leaders, the soldiers or their brave chiefs, the
Cambrian army or their lawful prince.&nbsp; They were exposed to
temptation, but they yielded not to its alluring charms.&nbsp;
Bribes were freely offered to many a Cambrian chieftain, but
these offers were made in vain.&nbsp; When at last treason
achieved the work which a far more powerful nation than the Welsh
failed to accomplish on the battle-field, let it be proclaimed to
the world, and let the fact be known to all ages to come, that
the traitor was a border man, and not a man in whose veins flowed
Cambrian blood.&nbsp; But he accomplished his work, and Llewelyn
was no more.&nbsp; His death was the direst calamity that had
ever befallen the Cambrian people.&nbsp; Strange as it might
appear, nevertheless it is an historical <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>fact, that
when Llewelyn&rsquo;s compatriots found that their brave prince
had fallen by the hands of an assassin, the spirit of heroism and
bravery appears to have forsaken them.&nbsp; Hence to the best,
and to the bravest of the brave, the struggle now appeared
hopeless, notwithstanding that Prince David still lived and was
free.&nbsp; Though that prince was as brave as his deceased
brother he did not command the same amount of confidence which
was reposed in the slain Llewelyn.&nbsp; Thus we find, that
though the struggle was continued, it lacked the boldness,
energy, and high military tactics which had characterized the
generalship of the martyred chief.&nbsp; Hence it soon became
evident to the enemy that the death-knell of Cambrian freedom and
independence had sounded, and that in a few days, or at any rate
in a few months at most, this ancient Principality would cease to
occupy a separate and distinct place in the annals of the
world.&nbsp; That the people in those times should have regarded
the downfall of their country, the loss of their freedom and
independence, as a terrible calamity, was but <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>natural.&nbsp; In King Edward&rsquo;s promises and
generosity the Welsh people had no confidence.&nbsp; To him and
to his immediate predecessor they traced, and correctly traced,
most of their troubles with the English nation.&nbsp; They had
desired to live in peace; war they did not invite.&nbsp; They
took up arms, not for conquest, not to extend their dominion, not
to annex new counties to the Principality, but simply in defence
of the rights and liberties of their country, which they desired
to transmit and hand down to their children and their
children&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; But Providence had, for some
grand purpose and design, willed that the weaker nation should be
united to the stronger and more powerful people.&nbsp; In this
age we behold and recognise the wisdom of His purpose.&nbsp;
Though a distinct race, in language, feeling, and mental and
physical idiosyncrasy, yet we unitedly admit that the benefits
which come to us by reason of our union with the Saxon, are
neither few nor unimportant.&nbsp; Happily, too, the ancient
feuds between the two races are forgotten.&nbsp; We now live as
<a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>brethren.&nbsp; The rivalry between us is no longer on
the battle-field; we contend not with sword and bayonet.&nbsp;
No! the contest is shifted to a more noble, a more beautiful, and
a grander scene, with a sublimer aim and object than ever has
characterized broad fields of battle; namely, the advancement of
material civilization; the triumphs of art and the conquests of
science; and the social, intellectual, moral, and religious
welfare of the people.&nbsp; May the standard of our contention
ever be towards this high ideal! then a glorious future awaits
the union of the Cambrian and Saxon peoples.</p>
<p>If now and then we of the former race drop a tear when the
shadows of our country&rsquo;s martyred princes pass by, it is
with no feeling of bitterness towards those into whose hands the
sceptre of our land has passed.&nbsp; On the contrary, while we
remember with pride and gratitude the heroic struggle of the
&ldquo;last of our native princes,&rdquo; we admit that it is
infinitely better for Wales that she should be united to England
under <a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>the beneficent sway of Victoria, and we have still a
Prince of Wales to whom the Cambrian people are as loyal as their
fathers were to Prince Llewelyn.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
